6000 degrees, and it has heated the Earth, so why is space at absolute zero?","text":"<p>The primary energy source on Earth comes from solar radiation, and the sun is able to continuously radiate energy because a controlled nuclear fusion reaction is taking place in its core. However, while the sun heats the Earth, the temperature of space between the Earth and the Sun is close to absolute zero. Why is that?</p> <p>Stellar nuclear fusion reaction To understand this, we first need to clarify how the sun generates energy. If it could be summed up in a sentence, it would be: extremes meet, it's all forced out by gravity. Why?</p> <p>The sun's mass is 330,000 times that of the Earth and accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system, making it the absolute dominant force in the solar system. Because of the sun's enormous mass, its gravitational pull is also substantial, which causes severe compression of the sun itself. As a result, the temperature of the sun's core rises sharply, reaching 15 million degrees.</p> <p>Even at this temperature, nuclear fusion reactions cannot be triggered. This is because nuclear fusion requires even more stringent conditions, at least hundreds of millions of degrees. For example, when scientists detonate a hydrogen bomb, they first detonate an atomic bomb, using the atomic bomb to provide a reaction temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees, thereby triggering a nuclear fusion reaction.</p> <p>So, what principle does the nuclear fusion in the sun's core rely on?</p> <p>Due to the extremely high temperature of the sun's core, the state of matter in the sun's core is no longer the common gas, solid, or liquid, but a plasma state. The so-called \"plasma state\" refers to when the electrons inside the atoms that make up matter obtain enough energy to become free electrons after breaking away from the nucleus. Therefore, the sun's core is more like a \"particle porridge\" mixed with various particles, filled with various atomic nuclei, electrons, and photons.</p> <p>This increases the likelihood of atomic nuclei meeting each other. However, because atomic nuclei are positively charged, according to the principle of like charges repelling each other, there is electrostatic repulsion between atomic nuclei, and fusion between atomic nuclei needs to overcome this \"repulsion\".</p> <p>In theory, the sun should not be able to undergo nuclear fusion reactions. However, in the microscopic world, there is a situation called quantum tunneling. The so-called \"quantum tunneling effect\" refers to the fact that even reactions that require energy have a certain probability of occurring in the microscopic world.</p> <p>However, the probability is extremely low, and it takes at least a billion years for a pair of atomic nuclei to fuse. Fortunately, the sun is large enough and has an extremely large number of particles, so even if the probability is very low, it can occur in front of such a huge base number of the sun. The whole process is divided into three stages, and finally, 4 hydrogen atomic nuclei fuse into 1 helium-4 atomic nucleus.</p> <p>Nuclear fusion generates outward pressure, which can counteract its own gravity, ensuring that the sun's gravity does not collapse on its own. This also forms a dynamic balance, preventing the sun from exploding all at once like a hydrogen bomb.</p> <p>There will be mass loss before and after the reaction, and this part of the mass will be released in the form of energy. In simple terms, photons and neutrinos will be produced in the core, and it takes an average of 140,000 years for photons to travel from the sun's core to the sun's surface, and then another 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth.</p> <p>So the question is, why haven't these photons heated up the cosmic space between the sun and the earth, but have baked the earth instead?</p> <p>The essence of temperature To understand this, we need to clarify the essence of temperature.</p> <p>From the perspective of the microscopic world, the essence of temperature is the intensity of particle thermal motion. This is because everything is composed of particles, but the particles are not neatly arranged together, but are in constant, chaotic motion.</p> <p>Scientists have found that if these particles move very intensely overall, the temperature reflected by the substance is high. If the particles don't move intensely overall, the reflected temperature is relatively low.</p> <p></p> <p>However, there is a prerequisite for achieving such results: a sufficient number of particles. In plain terms, to reflect a problem, there must be a sufficient number of particles in the first place. If there are no particles, we can't measure the temperature and it's hard to reflect the temperature.</p> <p>Sadly, space is really sparse. The average density of the universe is very close to 1*10^(-28) kg/cubic meter, which is about the level of one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. Therefore, when photons pass through the universe between the sun and the earth, due to the extremely low number of particles, photons cannot transfer their energy into this space. You can understand this as there are no particles present to receive these photons. Hence, it's difficult for photons to heat up the cosmic space.</p> <p>There has always been a belief that the temperature of space is absolute zero, but this idea is problematic. As mentioned above, it's actually challenging to measure the temperature of space. Moreover, the average temperature of the universe is -270.15 degrees Celsius, which is 2.7 degrees higher than absolute zero. This temperature comes from the residual heat left by the Big Bang, also known as cosmic microwave background radiation, but it's challenging to measure this temperature.</p> <p>Having understood why space doesn't get heated, we can easily understand why Earth gets heated. Earth is a celestial body with a particle heap, and its material density reaches 5507.85 kg/cubic meter, which is 31 orders of magnitude higher than the density of space. So when photons transfer to the Earth, the particles that make up the Earth can well receive these photons.</p> <p>In conclusion The biggest difference between space and Earth is material density, with the latter being 31 orders of magnitude higher than the former. For a material to be heated, it first needs a sufficiently large material density. Space, being so sparse, is hard to heat, while the Earth, with its particularly high material density, gets heated.</p>"},{"location":"20230601113201/","title":"\u6700\u72c2\uff01\u8dd1\u8d0f\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u516c\u52d9\u54e1","text":"<p>

He also announced on social media that he will wear the Chinese national team jersey and compete in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in August. Kyle Anderson was born in Fairview, New Jersey, USA. He was selected by the Spurs in the first round, 30th overall, in the 2014 NBA Draft and played for them for four years.</p> <p>He has played for the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves throughout his career. Anderson is 206 cm tall and weighs 104 kg, with an impressive wingspan of 220 cm.</p> <p>In the previous season, he played for the Timberwolves in 69 games, averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks per game. He had an all-around performance with a three-point shooting percentage of 41% and a field goal percentage of 50.9%.</p> <p>In international competitions, Anderson has previously participated in the training camps for the U16 and U17 US teams but has never represented the US in games. This fits FIBA's criteria for naturalized players, giving him the opportunity to switch national teams and compete for China.</p> <p>Anderson's connection with China comes from his mother's heritage. His great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, giving him one-eighth Chinese ancestry.</p> <p>Five years ago, in 2018, he embarked on a journey to China with his mother to explore his roots and left the name \"Li Kai'er\" in the family genealogy. It was then that the Chinese Basketball Association actively pursued Anderson to become a naturalized player. After announcing his Chinese citizenship on the 24th, Anderson shared his journey of becoming a Chinese citizen on Weibo with the username \"Da Hammer Li Kai'er.\"</p> <p>He recalled that the root-seeking trip in 2018 was very important to him as it showed him where his roots lie and how deep they go. He also expressed pride and honor in having his name written in the Li family genealogy.</p> <p>He also announced on social media that he will represent the Chinese national team in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup in August. The post shared by FIBA Basketball World Cup (@fibawc) about Anderson becoming Li Kai'er, China's first naturalized basketball player, has been widely commented on. It is seen as not only a change in China's basketball style but also an accelerator for the transformation of Chinese basketball.</p> <p>Sports commentator Li Yishen believes that Anderson has a well-rounded playing style, with the ability to handle the ball, control the game, and pass. He has a high basketball IQ and can activate China's interior offense and defense with his height and playmaking abilities.</p> <p>Especially since China lacks power and restraining ability in the interior, Anderson's addition can help the tall players inside, create space, organize passes, and create scoring opportunities. However, Anderson's unique playing style and slow pace may require time to integrate into China's playing system. In the end, Li Yishen believes that Anderson is not the solution for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although he is unique, he is not an NBA superstar who can dominate Asian opponents with his ball handling and individual skills. China needs top-notch coaches and improvements in player skills, physical fitness, and training systems.</p>"},{"location":"20230818160459469560/","title":"NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics' miraculous comeback in Game 6 ties series","text":"<p>The Boston Celtics, who were down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, managed to secure a narrow 104-103 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 6 on September 28    NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics' miraculous comeback in Game 6 ties series</p> <p>The Boston Celtics, who were down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, managed to secure a narrow 104-103 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 6 on September 28.

Brown has secured a 5-year, $304 million supermax contract extension, setting a new record for the highest salary in NBA history. Last season, Brown achieved career-high averages of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a crucial role in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals and was selected to the NBA All-Star Game for the first time. As a result, he earned the opportunity to sign a 5-year max contract extension with the Celtics.</p> <p>According to reports from Reuters, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the third overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. He has been selected to the NBA All-Star Game twice and will earn $28.5 million in the upcoming season.

This defeat could potentially lead to a rebuild of the Warriors' roster in the upcoming 2024 season.</p> <p>Steve Kerr, who is 57 years old, has been coaching the Warriors since the 2014-15 season. Prior to this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect 19-0 record against Western Conference teams in the playoffs. This means that whenever the Warriors made it to the postseason, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won the championship four times. </p> <p>Although the Warriors finished the regular season in 6th place, avoiding the play-in tournament, they had a tough first-round series against the Sacramento Kings, a team with little playoff experience. They only managed to advance after a hard-fought Game 7. Looking at the Warriors' core rotation, it is unlikely that they would trade their star player Stephen Curry, whose contract runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the \"Splash Brothers,\" is likely to be a target for trade by the team.</p> <p>According to a report from US sports media outlet \"Legion Hoops,\" Thompson will be in the final year of his contract next year, earning a salary of up to $43.21 million (approximately 1.34 billion New Taiwan dollars). Although the Warriors have the option to extend his contract, there have been rumors that the team wants the 33-year-old Thompson to take a pay cut for the extension.</p> <p>Furthermore, according to a report from US sports news website \"The Athletic,\" Draymond Green has a player option for the next season, but he must decide whether to exercise it by June 30, 2023. Although the Warriors are interested in re-signing him, it is not guaranteed that they would offer him a maximum contract. If Green becomes a free agent, there are likely to be many teams interested in acquiring him.</p> <p>In addition to the three main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only played an average of 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, has expressed some dissatisfaction. His agent revealed to \"The Athletic\" that if Kuminga is not included in the Warriors' future plans, he hopes to be traded to a team that will give him more opportunities.</p> <p>In the Western Conference playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the defending champions Golden State Warriors with a final score of 122-101. The Lakers will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers had a 3-2 advantage going into the game and outperformed the Warriors in various aspects. LeBron James had 30 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists, while Anthony Davis contributed 17 points and 20 rebounds. Austin Reaves made 4 out of 5 three-pointers, scoring a total of 23 points for the Lakers. On the Warriors' side, despite Stephen Curry's game-high 32 points and Andrew Wiggins playing despite a rib injury, Klay Thompson struggled, and the team's three-point shooting was inefficient, making only 13 out of 48 attempts. The Lakers led by 5 points at the end of the first quarter and extended their lead to 10 points by halftime. In the second half, the Lakers continued to dominate, and the Warriors couldn't catch up. The Lakers secured a 14-point lead going into the fourth quarter and maintained their advantage until the end of the game.</p> <p>As the 7th seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers defeated the 2nd seed Memphis Grizzlies in the first round and eliminated the 6th seed Warriors in the second round.

The ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, will also kick off in New Zealand on July 20.</p> <p>Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand national team and a driving force behind the agreement, pointed out that the fight for pay equality is not just about salaries, but about the value of women's sports and sending positive messages to generations of young girls who wear soccer shoes.</p> <p>Meo added, \"We can't celebrate yet because we still have to see how this deal plays out, and we've only received what we should have gotten.\"</p> <p>The Washington Post reported that while New Zealand's global image has been improving, their soccer industry has long had issues with gender pay disparities and unequal distribution of resources. Most of New Zealand's soccer clubs are amateur clubs run by volunteers, and the maximum salary a player can receive is regulated by the national soccer federation at around $94 per week. However, whether the clubs will distribute salaries equally has not received much attention from the government. In the New Zealand soccer scene, women receive much lower salaries, fewer training opportunities, and less access to facilities and coaching staff compared to men. Typically, women's teams have only one coach while men's teams have several.</p> <p>Last year, members of the Manukau United soccer team in New Zealand launched a campaign for equal pay and resources for men and women, but it ended in failure. Maia Jackman, a team member, stated, \"Many female players from various teams would stand up for themselves, but they would face setbacks and eventually give up. However, the people at Western Springs are different. They have consistently stood by their beliefs and never backed down.\"</p> <p>Meo and Jackman joined the Western Springs Association, where almost all board members are male, in an attempt to achieve gender equality in the soccer world once again in 2023.</p> <p>After two months of struggle, Meo and Jackman, along with two pro bono lawyers, reached an agreement with the club's management through a 12-hour marathon mediation session and the threat of a strike, achieving gender equality.</p> <p>The club also issued a statement acknowledging past flaws and offering apologies.</p> <p>Regarding the successful negotiation, Meo responded that the new agreement has not yet been officially implemented, so they cannot be too happy too soon, while Jackman stated, \"Ultimately, we just want to play football without any restrictions or concerns.\"</p> <p>Jackman said her focus will now be on the World Cup, hoping that through this event, the world can see the charm of women's soccer. According to reports from CBS and Lexology, gender pay inequality is prevalent in many sports worldwide. Taking basketball as an example, the average annual income for male NBA players is $5.3 million, with even higher earnings for star players like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, who earned $45.7 million and $42 million in annual salaries last year, respectively.</p> <p>In comparison, the average annual income for female WNBA players is only $130,000, and the highest-earning player in the league makes only $230,000 per year.</p> <p>However, the reports also point out that the main reason for the large wage gap between men and women in sports is the lower popularity and resulting revenue and ticket sales in women's sports, which naturally leads to lower salaries.</p> <p>The NBA generated approximately $10 billion in revenue last season, while the WNBA only had $60 million. However, when focusing on American football, the U.S. women's soccer team has generated more revenue and attracted more viewers than the men's team since 2019, yet their income and prize money for winning were still lower than their male counterparts until last year.</p> <p>According to Lexology, the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to increase the promotion of women's sports. Encouraging media and advertising to highlight female athletes and encouraging businesses to invest in women's sports and athletes through commercial partnerships and sponsorships will garner more attention for female athletes, generate more ticket sales, and contribute to achieving gender pay equality.</p>"},{"location":"20230818160641775980/","title":"The NBA has renamed the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, which recognizes the player with the most outstanding performance in the regular season, as the Michael Jordan Trophy, paying tribute to one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history","text":"<p>The NBA has renamed the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, which recognizes the player with the most outstanding performance in the regular season, as the Michael Jordan Trophy, paying tribute to one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history.

Lin, who is currently in the United States, posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing the number 7 jersey on social media with the caption \"I'm here, Kaohsiung.\" Rumors of Lin joining the Taiwanese professional basketball league had been circulating since the end of last year, but the team had not confirmed until now. The announcement by P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year came as a shock to the Taiwanese basketball scene.</p> <p>The 2022-23 season of the Taiwanese professional basketball league has been full of surprises. The Taoyuan Yongfeng Clouded Leopards, a team from the neighboring T1 League, first signed former NBA All-Star Dwight Howard. Now, PLG has recruited the highly popular Lin, creating a situation where two big stars will face off in Taiwan. Rumors of Lin returning to play in Taiwan had been brewing since last year, but at the time, he was still playing for the Guangzhou Loong Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). It wasn't until the end of last year that he announced his decision to leave the CBA and return to Taiwan.</p> <p>Since Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-wei, currently plays for the New Taipei Kings, a team ranked at the top of the PLG, Jeremy had expressed his desire to have the opportunity to play alongside his brother during his professional career. Although they won't be playing on the same team, the brothers will soon have the chance to compete against each other in the same league, taking a big step towards their \"reunion.\"</p> <p>In addition to posting a photo of himself wearing the Steel's jersey on social media, Lin wrote, \"Kaohsiung, I'm here.\" Many fans have left supportive comments, with one fan writing, \"Welcome to Kaohsiung, the people of Kaohsiung will support you to the end.\" Another fan wrote, \"Taiwan welcomes you back to play basketball,\" showing their excitement and support for Lin's return.</p> <p>P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel officially announced the signing of Taiwanese basketball star Jeremy Lin. Recognizing the long-standing imbalance in Taiwanese basketball between the north and south, Lin supports the Steel's \"Great Southern Plan\" and hopes to contribute to the team's efforts.</p> <p>Lin, who previously sparked \"Linsanity\" in the NBA, has played in top professional leagues such as the NBA and CBA for many years. He ended his contract with the CBA's Beijing Ducks and decided to return to his homeland of Taiwan after the Lunar New Year holiday. Lin's NBA journey was not without challenges. Although he signed contracts with the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, he didn't receive much playing time. He had to go back and forth between the NBA and development leagues. It wasn't until 2012, when he joined the New York Knicks, that he seized the opportunity to score 25 points off the bench, along with 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading the team to a victory and capturing the attention of fans. In subsequent games, Lin continued to deliver impressive performances, achieving double-double stats against star guards like John Wall and scoring a career-high 38 points against the late Kobe Bryant. The \"Linsanity\" phenomenon became a hot topic in the global basketball community, and Lin even graced the cover of TIME magazine and was selected as one of TIME 100's most influential people in 2012.</p> <p>After nearly 10 years of playing in the NBA, Lin won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 before joining the CBA's Beijing Ducks, where he averaged 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. Wherever Lin went, the arenas were filled to capacity, and he became the crowd favorite. He terminated his contract with the Beijing Ducks at the end of last year and joined the Kaohsiung Steel after the Lunar New Year holiday. The Kaohsiung Steel team stated in a press release that the \"Linsanity\" phenomenon was not a coincidence. In addition to Lin's high self-discipline and refusal to give up, he was always ready to seize opportunities. When the New York Knicks were in a losing streak, Lin took advantage of the opportunity and led the team to overcome adversity, achieving a winning streak and making it to the playoffs, proving his worth. The Steel team's current situation is similar, and Lin's arrival is expected to fill the team's lack of experience in the backcourt. His addition will not only bring substantial strength to the Steel but also provide more opportunities for the team's promising young guards Chen Yu-wei and Wang Lu-xiang to grow. </p> <p>As the only team in southern Taiwan in P. LEAGUE+, the Kaohsiung Steel joined the league last year and has been actively promoting the \"Great Southern Plan\" to gradually address the resource imbalance in Taiwanese basketball between the north and south. The aim is to enable more young players in the south to stay and play in their hometowns. With Lin's joining and support, the Steel's \"Great Southern Plan\" will take a big step forward.</p> <p>A devout Christian, Jeremy Lin has had a longstanding connection with the Fengshan Gymnasium, the home arena of the Kaohsiung Steel. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and testimony under the theme \"Unceasing Breakthrough\" with nearly 5,000 churchgoers and fans, sharing the strength his faith has given him. After becoming an NBA player, he faced many challenges and discrimination, but he adjusted his pace, bravely embraced challenges, and overcame them.</p> <p>According to the team's general manager, Gao Jing-yan, Lin's decision to join the team was driven by his sense of responsibility and mission, both for himself and for the overall development of basketball. He was well aware that basketball development in Taiwan has been concentrated in the north, with the south relatively less vibrant. He hopes that his joining the team can change the viewing culture of basketball fans in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and change to the southern market.</p> <p>Jeremy Lin's basketball career has always been about defying the impossible. When he went undrafted and faced skepticism as a Chinese-American, he still successfully entered the NBA and made a name for himself. Now, as he chooses to join the Kaohsiung Steel, fans are eagerly anticipating whether he can replicate the success of \"Linsanity\" in the NBA and transform himself into the team's savior.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161058997757/","title":"Article: In the first game of the Western Conference first round between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies, Grizzlies guard Ja Morant painfully lay on the court after a drive and went straight to the locker room due to a hand injury, ending his battle in that game","text":"<p>Article: In the first game of the Western Conference first round between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies, Grizzlies guard Ja Morant painfully lay on the court after a drive and went straight to the locker room due to a hand injury, ending his battle in that game. Subsequently, the Los Angeles Lakers turned a closely contested game into an easy away victory.</p> <p>Soon after, a similar scene unfolded in Milwaukee, as Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo lay on the court in pain, clutching his back.</p> <p>Without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks also lost their chance to win the first game of the series. Morant and Antetokounmpo, the two star players of their respective teams, not only suffered injuries in the playoffs but also share a commonality in the way they got injured.</p> <p>Both Morant and Antetokounmpo fell hard after driving to the basket, with defenders attempting to create offensive fouls.</p> <p>Anthony Davis successfully blocked Morant, while Kevin Love was called for a foul, sending Antetokounmpo to the free-throw line. With star players spending less and less time on the court, the league needs to start considering how to increase their playing time. Besides raising the threshold for awards, another issue worth discussing is whether the penalties after fouls are sufficient to protect players from unnecessary injuries caused by dangerous landings.</p> <p>Although Morant and Antetokounmpo were absent in the following second game, neither suffered career-ending injuries and both returned to play in their respective series. However, we have seen many promising young stars whose careers were cut short due to injuries, so how to prevent the next player with a similar experience has become a primary concern.</p> <p>The most extreme possibility is to prohibit any help defender from creating offensive fouls, an idea proposed by Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, in his personal blog in 2004.</p> <p>Cuban acknowledged that the Mavericks did a great job of creating offensive fouls, and the players' willingness to endure physical pain for defensive purposes is commendable, but he believes this rule is \"terrible\" for the NBA.</p> <p>He mentioned in the article, \"This not only increases the risk of injury for both players, but also weakens some of the most exciting and watchable performances in basketball. Players no longer focus on making spectacular, incredible shots near the basket, but instead lower their heads and look at the ground to see if someone will try to obstruct them by creating offensive fouls.\" It is worth noting that this proposal would not reduce the blocks made by primary defenders to prevent players like Antetokounmpo from attacking the basket.</p> <p>According to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, he committed 233 offensive fouls in the past 10 seasons while driving to the basket, and this only happened when facing opponents who wanted to stop him at the frontline.</p> <p>Furthermore, even if players can knock down help defenders without being called for traveling, NBA rules also prohibit players from creating \"non-basketball contact\" beyond the concept of the body cylinder, meaning that intentional unnecessary pushing actions against help defenders are not allowed. However, in this era where offensive efficiency is higher than ever, such changes seem to favor the offensive side too much. When Cuban proposed this in 2004, offensive efficiency was at its lowest, so they had to find a way to give offensive players an advantage. The league's average offensive efficiency in the 2003-04 season was 101.4 points per 100 possessions.</p> <p>This season, that number has risen to 114.1. It is worth praising that long before Morant was born, the NBA already had a rule aimed at preventing player injuries, known as the \"restricted area\" under the basket, and since the 1997-98 season, the restricted area has been expanded to its current size (four feet in diameter).</p> <p>The NBA was the first league to introduce the restricted area, and later the NCAA and FIBA also adopted this rule. However, since this rule was implemented 26 years ago, the game has undergone significant changes.</p> <p>Back then, the offensive range was much smaller than it is now. In the 1997-98 season, only 16% of shots came from three-pointers, while this season, the proportion of three-point attempts has reached 39%. As long-distance three-pointers become more popular, the average shooting distance also continues to increase.</p> <p>According to ESPN's statistics, in the 1997-98 season, the average distance of jump shots outside the paint was 18.4 feet (excluding logo shots), while this season, the average shooting distance outside the paint is 22.8 feet, an increase of over 4 feet.</p> <p>Expanding the offensive space requires defenders to cover more area, which means they are more likely to move actively to legal defensive positions near the offensive player when they take off from outside the paint. According to the rules, such \"delayed standing\" defensive actions are prohibited. Defenders attempting to obstruct offensive players by creating offensive fouls are not allowed to \"move into the path of the offensive player when the offensive player begins his upward motion.\"</p> <p>In other words, as long as the offensive player takes off to attack the basket after receiving the ball, defenders cannot attempt to step into a position outside the restricted area to create offensive fouls at that moment. This is the reason why Love's defense against Antetokounmpo was called a foul. However, in reality, it is difficult for referees to simultaneously determine the position of the defender and the timing of the offensive player's takeoff. Therefore, whether the defender is inside the restricted area often becomes the primary criterion for distinguishing between blocking fouls and charging fouls, which is why Cuban advocates increasing the radius of the restricted area to five feet.</p> <p>This proposal is not made rashly. As early as 2006, Cuban publicly suggested expanding the restricted area and hoped it would \"cover the entire paint.\"</p> <p>If the restricted area is larger, cases like Morant's injury would be considered fouls on Davis, so Davis would not attempt to create offensive fouls in the first place.</p> <p>Instead, Davis might prepare to block Morant's shot, which he is good at. He contributed a total of seven blocks on Sunday, repeatedly thwarting the Grizzlies' attacks.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161143840136/","title":"NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as \"Melo,\" announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter yesterday","text":"<p>NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as \"Melo,\" announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter yesterday. After 19 seasons, Anthony, who will turn 39 next week, expressed his gratitude and said, \"The time has come for me to say goodbye.\" Throughout his career, Anthony played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Los Angeles Lakers, accumulating a total of 28,289 points and ranking 9th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. He was a 10-time NBA All-Star and a 6-time All-NBA selection. Thank you, Carmelo! \ud83d\udc4f</p> <p>As one of the NBA's 75 greatest players and ranking 9th on the all-time scoring list, Carmelo Anthony, known as \"Melo,\" announced his retirement in a sentimental manner. Having not appeared in the NBA for over a year, he bid farewell to the court with the regret of never winning a championship. Anthony emotionally announced his retirement in a video on Twitter, saying, \"For me, the time to say goodbye has come. Basketball has given me goals and made me proud.\" His last appearance in the NBA was during the 2021-22 season with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he did not receive any offers for this season (2022-23), resulting in no playing records.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Anthony has already achieved great accomplishments. He was selected as one of the NBA's 75 greatest players, and at almost 39 years old, he has been selected as an All-Star player 10 times. Throughout his 19 seasons, he played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Lakers, accumulating a total of 28,289 points (averaging 22.5 points per game) and ranking 9th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Known for his scoring abilities and being dubbed the \"offensive maestro,\" he has had numerous career highlights, with the exception of an NBA championship ring. The closest he came was leading the Nuggets to the Western Conference Finals in 2009, only to be defeated by the eventual champions, the Lakers.</p> <p>However, Anthony has had a brilliant record representing the United States in Olympic basketball. He won gold medals in 2008, 2012, and 2016, and in total, he played in 31 Olympic games, the most by any American male player.</p> <p>Selected as the third overall pick by the Nuggets in the highly regarded 2003 NBA Draft, Anthony was part of a draft class that included top pick LeBron James, fourth pick Chris Bosh, and fifth pick Dwyane Wade, among other notable players.</p> <p>Among these four players, Anthony is the only one who did not win an NBA championship. His golden era came during his time with the Nuggets and Knicks, but his emphasis on offense over defense prevented him from leading his teams to the expected results. As the years took a toll and injuries plagued him, his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game starting from the 2017-18 season when he joined the Thunder, breaking his streak of 14 consecutive seasons with over 20 points per game.</p> <p>Since then, his performance declined, and he spent his last season with the Lakers, averaging a career-low 13.3 points per game.</p> <p>On October 24, 2021, in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony surpassed Moses Malone on the all-time scoring list, moving up to 9th place.</p> <p>After retirement, Anthony will focus on his son, Kiyan.

Fortunately, he was quickly taken to the hospital and is now out of the intensive care unit.</p> <p>However, this collapse may undermine all the efforts he has made so far. As LeBron's son, Bronny has had to face more attention and pressure than the average \"basketball second generation\". After all, he is not just a player's son, but the son of a legend who has a significant position in the entire NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent would be scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's dominance in high school, Bronny's leadership skills are clearly not as remarkable as LeBron's. Although he still possesses good natural abilities, he has not demonstrated the same level of dominance in high school basketball as his father did, and at one point, he was even considered to be riding on his father's coattails. Nevertheless, despite the unfavorable criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning a spot on the McDonald's All-American High School team. He was given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets and received basketball scholarships from some top NCAA Division I schools.</p> <p>These achievements have significantly raised Bronny's draft prospects, going from a possible undrafted player to potentially impacting the first round or even the lottery.</p> <p>Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's reputation. LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance that he will join his son's team and play together. This \"son-picking-father\" operation undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value, but we must not overlook Bronny's own efforts.</p> <p>Ultimately, he chose to attend the University of Southern California (USC) and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to enrollment, he posted on his social media that he wants those who doubt him to take notice.</p> <p>However, the heart problem that has emerged before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. Bronny's case, hindered by heart problems on the path to the NBA, reminds me of another \"basketball second generation,\" Shaquille O'Neal's son, Shareef O'Neal.</p> <p>During high school, Shareef did achieve some notable results and was regarded as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required urgent surgery.</p> <p>Post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to be absent from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months, which was detrimental to a rising player. The golden development period was wasted, and his skills and competitiveness may have fallen far behind. In addition, with Shareef's condition, he was already not dominant in the more intense NCAA. Coaches at the university, fearing a relapse and considering performance, did not give Shareef much time, leading to a significant decline in his college performance. Eventually, he faced the fate of going undrafted in the NBA. \"I always told Shareef that he would never be the next me. I want him to play his own game, his own style,\" Shaquille said. \"Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path. At that time, I had the pressure to succeed because I wanted to improve my life. But Shareef didn't, so I hope he can find his own goals and strive for them.\" Currently, Shareef is still developing in the league, waiting for an opportunity. Although he only averaged 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the last season, overcoming the shadow of his heart problem is a major breakthrough. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be confined by his father's achievements and reputation but to bravely pursue the path he chooses. LeBron most likely sees Bronny in the same way, as his love for his child will not be affected by his draft position. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and will establish his own value in the new season.</p> <p>This article is authorized by the author, originally published here.

After retiring in 2017, he became an NBA commentator for TNT.</p> <p>However, Davis is not only a basketball player but also a low-profile top entrepreneur. During his playing career, he signed six contracts and earned a total salary of approximately $147 million. However, he didn't rely solely on his salary to make money.</p> <p>Currently, Davis is the founder of several companies spanning various industries. These include the sports content platform Sports Lifestyle in Culture (SLiC) and the multimedia company UWish.</p> <p>In 2020, when the Taiwan professional basketball league P. LEAGUE+ was established, CEO Chen Chien-chou publicly announced that Baron Davis, under the connection of Silicon Valley Taiwan Help, became one of the shareholders, including New Taipei Kings CEO Chen Hsin-sheng.</p> <p>Davis is also one of the shareholders of the East Asia Super League (EASL). The East Super League will start a brand-new home-and-away match system in 2023, focusing on developing content and videos to expand basketball's influence in Asia. Davis represents the early investors who enjoy the benefits. What's more important is that he brings his precise vision from the basketball court into the business world.</p> <p>His first investment was buying shares in Vitaminwater. In 2007, Coca-Cola announced the acquisition of Vitaminwater for $4.1 billion, and Davis received a substantial return. Following that, Davis became an angel investor for the online membership-based retailer Thrive Market in 2014. Thrive Market experienced explosive growth during the pandemic, showcasing Davis's successful investment insight once again. In 2016, Davis participated in the Series A investment of the flower delivery company Bloomthat, which far exceeded its valuation at the time.</p> <p>Due to his precise vision and diligent research, Davis's main investment field leans towards early-stage investments. Besides profitability, he hopes to have a positive impact on society and support minority entrepreneurship.</p> <p>For example, in 2021, he invested in the women's medical cannabis care brand House of Wise.</p> <p>\"I like investing in startups because these companies have the potential to become changemakers for the next generation, moving us towards a better direction,\" Davis said. \"By investing, I become a changemaker and help businesses have a greater impact. I've experienced various situations on the court, from strong teams to underdogs, being upset or defeating strong teams. So I understand the ups and downs. Now, as a serial entrepreneur, I understand the passion, energy, determination, and risk-taking required by startups. I can discuss different scenarios and coping strategies with these entrepreneurs. Being bold and detail-oriented is my advantage.\"</p> <p>Although Davis's talent as a player may not be considered top-notch, he has a knack for investment and accumulating wealth. At the age of 43, Davis can be called a pioneer in athlete entrepreneurship. His earnings and endorsements during his playing career were not substantial. However, he paved another path through research, investment, and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Davis is perhaps one of the few retired players who became busier after retirement, with a busy schedule and budget every season. \"In a season, I study about 25-30 companies and invest in five of them,\" Davis said. One of the venture capital firms he owns, Business Inside The Game, primarily invests in African Americans, women, Middle Eastern or Indian descent, and the LGBTQ+ community. \"I hope to empower them and use investment to amplify the ideas and willpower of these minority groups for the majority to understand, enabling cultural co-prosperity.\" He also founded the content brand company Black Santa, creating cross-cultural animated characters and launching exclusive content and merchandise to achieve both profitability and public welfare goals. \"I want to present stories of heroes and cartoon characters to African Americans and all ethnic groups, allowing people of all skin colors to identify with, unite, and be entertained.\" Besides socially impactful investments, Davis has also been involved in some major commercial mergers or transactions. In 2020, when adidas intended to sell Reebok, Davis and a group of investors led by rapper Master P made a bid. In addition to mature business models, Davis is also very willing to try emerging and high-risk investments, such as the metaverse, Web3.0, cryptocurrency blockchain games, and NFTs. Black Santa released a charitable NFT during Christmas 2021, which sold out in 14 minutes. \"When facing such new technologies and fields, don't be overwhelmed, but try to understand and participate. Technology is just a tool; how to use it is the key,\" Davis said. He believes that Web3.0 and the development of cryptocurrency are well-suited for professional athletes who already have a voice and creators who are creative but not fond of commercial aspects. \"This is a brand-new opportunity that everyone can participate in.\" In recent years, Davis has been involved in content platforms with Web3.0 characteristics, including Overtime and Fireside. Davis believes that NBA players have their own voice and influence. With his star status, he can build his own brand and earn wealth and fame like other internet celebrities. However, he doesn't like doing that. \"I prefer to help and give back. That's the true value for me,\" said former NBA player Brandon Jennings, who regards Davis as the godfather of Los Angeles basketball. \"Besides being good at basketball, he often comes back to the streets to take care of us. He has always been giving back, especially to his hometown. You can call BD anytime, and he will answer the phone.\" Davis's investment enlightenment stems from wanting to break free from the exploitation of the professional basketball industry. \"I felt like I was being 'robbed.' When I was a rookie, I had no concept, so I needed agents and business managers to assist me. But after my three-year contract ended, I decided to do it myself.\" Davis not only broke the mold by not hiring agents but also started thinking about how to invest in himself. He decided to negotiate contracts and build a team to handle commercial activities. \"I'm not afraid to break with tradition. I'm very willing to try and break through the status quo.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230818161414015006/","title":"38-year-old Lakers star LeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to average 28","text":"<p>38-year-old Lakers star LeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to average 28.9 points in his 20th season.</p> <p>The NBA playoffs will begin today (12th), marking the completion of LeBron James' 20th regular season. According to statistics, James averaged 28.9 points this season, the highest among players who have completed 20 seasons in the league.</p> <p>Despite only playing in 55 games this season due to injuries, James still leads the team with an average of 28.9 points. If it weren't for his limited playing time, the 38-year-old James could have ranked 7th in the league's scoring list. On January 31st, James recorded 28 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, leading the team to victory with an excellent triple-double performance.</p> <p>In NBA history, there are a total of 11 players who have completed at least 20 seasons, including James and the recently retired Heat spiritual leader, 42-year-old Haslem (Udonis Haslem). However, only James can perform like a young player.

The third place is Dirk Nowitzki in the 2017-18 season, averaging 12 points. James graduated from high school in 2003 and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick that year.</p> <p>Since 2006, the NBA has banned high school students from joining the league directly after graduation. For James, playing one year ahead gave him an advantage.</p> <p>According to ESPN, James mentioned in an interview that he owes his ability to play 20 seasons and maintain a high level of performance to his personal trainer, Mike Mancias.</p> <p>James said, \"Without him, it would be impossible for me to perform at this level. He plays a crucial role in my game and my performance. I could play 7 to 12 seasons on my own, but 20 seasons without him would be impossible.\"</p> <p>Mancias was hired as the assistant strength and conditioning trainer for the Cavaliers in the 2002 season and developed a good working relationship with James, who joined the team the following year.

Why? Mainly because the past few contests have been quite lackluster.</p> <p>But to be honest, it's not entirely their fault. I often feel that after the classic showdown between Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in 2016, the audience's taste has become more refined. If there are no more creative dunks, explosive dunk tension, or elegant aerial displays, naturally, people will find it boring.</p> <p>However, these moves require exceptional talent (jumping ability, hang time) to execute. Even if you have the talent, you still need to come up with innovative ideas to overcome the high wall of dunk contest viewership.</p> <p>But Mac McClung, a young white guard who came from the development league, has shattered everyone's expectations.</p> <p>\"He deserves to be in the NBA.\" \"Although he's a bit small, this kid can really jump.\" \"I believe Mac McClung won't disappoint in the dunk contest.\" \"He might even become the first non-NBA player to win the dunk contest.\"</p> <p>These are the appreciative comments from basketball analyst Shaquille O'Neal. So who is this Mac McClung? Mac McClung has been a talented athlete since he was young. Despite being only 188 centimeters tall, his explosive athleticism sets him apart from his peers. He was the absolute leader of his high school basketball team and even broke the school's scoring record.</p> <p>The previous record holder was none other than the famous former NBA star Allen Iverson. \"He's been really good to me, a great mentor.\" \"He taught me a lot of things that will be helpful for my future.\" McClung's impressive performances caught Iverson's attention, and he even invited McClung to participate in his own classic game. During the game, McClung's dunks left a deep impression on Iverson, and they had a meaningful conversation afterwards, according to McClung's recollection.</p> <p>It is his outstanding offensive abilities that attracted the attention of many colleges, and he ultimately chose to attend Georgetown University, just like Iverson. However, the transition from high school to college intensified the competition, and McClung's offensive skills were not as sharp as they were in high school. His shooting accuracy also suffered. Even after transferring to a new environment after two years, things didn't improve. After all, being too small in stature, it's hard to survive in college basketball without elite ball handling and shooting skills.</p> <p>Yes! At this level, being elite is not enough. Without surpassing the limitations of height, it's really difficult to thrive on the college court, let alone the NBA.</p> <p>Therefore, after spending three years in college and realizing that his draft prospects weren't changing much, McClung decided to enter the draft and pursue his dream.</p> <p>Unlike in a passionate comic, he went undrafted. In the 2021 draft, no team was willing to give him a chance. But this didn't extinguish McClung's dream of playing in the NBA. He immediately sought opportunities in the development league and had stints with the Lakers, Bulls, and Warriors. This year, he signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers but mostly spent his time honing his skills in the development league. \"I feel like I'm a bit sloppy on the defensive end.\" \"I need to find ways to improve myself in every game.\" \"I think I do pretty well in lob passes.\" \"But in other types of passes, I can definitely do better.\"</p> <p>In development league games, McClung worked hard to refine his skills. When he was released by the Warriors last season, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr earnestly told him that as a player of his height, he needs to improve his passing skills, in addition to scoring. With McClung's efforts to improve, he even won the G League's Rookie of the Year award last season. \"If it happens, it would be amazing!\" \"It means I've earned recognition from the NBA!\" In fact, McClung is like a video game character who maximizes all his points in athleticism. His flexibility is astonishing, and he often uploads videos of himself dunking on his personal social media platforms, gaining more fans than some NBA players. He didn't stop showcasing his explosive dunks in the development league. On the contrary, many fans eagerly await his breathtaking dunks every night. It is this high popularity that caught the attention of the league and allowed him to participate in this year's dunk contest. \"I'm lucky and grateful that the NBA gave me this opportunity.\"</p> <p>In his first dunk, McClung flew over two people, tapped the ball off the backboard, and then reverse dunked it, displaying both difficulty and creativity, earning him a perfect score of 50. In his second dunk, McClung soared into the air, twisted his body, and threw down a dunk while turning around. One judge even raised a 50-point card, but in the final scoring, due to one judge giving him only 49 points, McClung's score was 49.8. However, it was enough for him to advance to the final.</p> <p>In his third dunk, McClung flew over one person, executed two mid-air spins, and finished with a reverse dunk, earning a perfect score of 50 without any controversy. For his final dunk, McClung put on his high school jersey, took off, and rotated nearly 540 degrees in the air before slamming the ball into the hoop. After landing, he imitated the famous gesture of dunker Vince Carter in the dunk contest and said, \"It's over.\" This dunk received unanimous applause from the crowd, and McClung won the dunk contest championship.</p> <p>\"If you guys will have me, I'll come back.\" After the game, McClung said in an interview that if he's still in the league next year, he would definitely be willing to defend his title.</p> <p>Perhaps he also knows that he still has many shortcomings to overcome if he wants to establish himself in the league. After all, there are many players who have won the dunk contest but lost their place in the NBA.</p> <p>\"I've always wanted to see things I've never seen before.\" \"I hope I can achieve that through my dunks.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230818161534369236/","title":"Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic wrote NBA history by becoming the first player ever to achieve 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in the first five games of a season","text":"<p>Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic wrote NBA history by becoming the first player ever to achieve 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in the first five games of a season.

The top three picks had their own unique characteristics. As expected, \"French Monster\" Victor Wembanyama became the first overall pick and joined the San Antonio Spurs. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama's physical attributes have attracted attention. Not only does he possess the shooting touch of a guard, but he also has the mobility of a forward. Wembanyama has been considered the top choice for the first overall pick for the past five months.</p> <p>Wembanyama is now the third player in Spurs history to be selected as the first overall pick, following David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. Both of these great centers helped the Spurs win NBA championships.</p> <p>Now, Wembanyama carries the weight of this responsibility. The Spurs have won the NBA championship five times in their history, with the most recent one being in the 2013-14 season. It is also because of Wembanyama that the Spurs have decided to extend the contract of the legendary coach Gregg Popovich for three more years. They hope to rely on his experience in coaching French stars like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to help Wembanyama quickly adapt to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA. Wembanyama shed tears of joy after becoming the first overall pick, saying in an interview with ESPN, \"When I heard the NBA Commissioner announce my name, it was like a dream come true. I have dreamt about this moment many times, that's why I cried.\"</p> <p>As for the second overall pick, Brandon Miller, who stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm), has excellent 3D physical attributes. He is also the only player among the top three picks who played college basketball in the United States. Although he was picked by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his tryout with the Hornets, Miller told the then-owner and \"Basketball God\" Michael Jordan that he is not his idol and has rarely watched Jordan play. Miller's journey to becoming the second overall pick has been full of twists and turns. Just a year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the number one seed in the NCAA men's basketball tournament, the University of Alabama, which propelled him to a lottery pick.</p> <p>However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with his college teammates. Although he was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, it almost ended his basketball career.</p> <p>If it wasn't for Wembanyama, the 6-foot-2-inch (188 cm) explosive athlete Jaden Henderson would have had a good chance of becoming this year's first overall pick. Henderson is praised for his good passing vision, excellent physical condition, and leadership qualities on the court. Other than needing to improve his three-point shooting, he has few weaknesses and has a great chance of becoming a highly regarded rookie in the league.</p> <p>Henderson played in 19 games in the developmental league this year, starting in all of them. He averaged 16.5 points and 6.8 assists per game, but only had a three-point shooting percentage of 27.5%.</p> <p>It remains to be seen what will happen after the Trail Blazers selected Henderson. Will they initiate a trade involving their star player Damian Lillard, or will they pair him up with Henderson to form a backcourt duo? Only time will tell.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161747650077/","title":"2022 Popular Keywords Review: Taiwan Star's Massive Disconnection and NAC Cough Medicine Rumor Becomes a Hot Search","text":"<p>As we approach the end of 2022, let's take a look back at the year with Google's daily trending keywords    2022 Popular Keywords Review: Taiwan Star's Massive Disconnection and NAC Cough Medicine Rumor Becomes a Hot Search</p> <p>As we approach the end of 2022, let's take a look back at the year with Google's daily trending keywords.</p> <p>This article reviews the events that drew everyone's attention in May 2022.

However, in private, he has a side that most people don't know about. First of all, he is very fond of \"fragrance.\" For example, he has four perfumes that he is very fond of, such as \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Crystal Flame,\" \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian OUD,\" \"Louis Vuitton L'IMMENSITE,\" and \"Louis Vuitton Les Sables Roses.\" Among them, \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Crystal Flame\" has floral, amber, and woody notes, bringing out the mineral fragrance of ambergris with floral scents like jasmine and saffron, as well as woody and red cedar spicy scents. On the other hand, \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian OUD\" showcases sweet saffron, labdanum, Moroccan cedar, sweet vanilla, and musk in the top notes, while the base notes are dominated by Laotian agarwood and Indonesian patchouli.</p> <p>In addition, there is also \"Louis Vuitton L'IMMENSITE,\" which is a blend of grapefruit, ginger, rock rose, and a moderate amount of amber fragrance, as well as \"Louis Vuitton Les Sables Roses,\" which combines rose with agarwood from Baghdad and has spices, leather, and animalistic scents. These are the perfumes that Howard loves.</p> <p>Furthermore, Howard is also very fond of scented candles. Whether at home, on the road, or even when watching movies, he always brings scented candles with him. Another item that Howard likes to carry with him at all times is \"sage.\" He has different types of sage, such as rosemary sage, blood sage, and wheel sage. Every time he returns home or enters the team's locker room, he smokes sage to purify himself.</p> <p>In the past, Dwight Howard (@dwighthoward) used to bring sage and smoke the entire court and every teammate before every game in the NBA.</p> <p>For Howard, this practice allows his mind to find peace and gain energy on the court. Apart from sage, there are also other objects that bring peace to Howard's mind, such as the Bible, quartz, and singing bowls, which open his mind.</p> <p>In addition to the above, he has many different habits and interests. For example, he loves chewing gum and mala beads, which freshen his breath. He also has as many as 20 to 30 speakers at home, and he always brings a speaker to the court to play music during practice. His teammates even call him \"Radio Raheem\" or \"MC Tight Sound.\"</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that this former NBA star is just like you and me, a fan who loves watching TV shows and movies. His favorite TV show is \"Game of Thrones,\" and he has watched each season at least 10 times. However, no matter how much he loves it, he also feels dumbfounded and disappointed with the ending. If you are curious about this basketball superstar who has the most fame in Taiwanese basketball history, you can follow Howard on his social media accounts. After previously live-streaming and sharing various local snacks he tasted in Taiwan, he will surely show his unique side on the court again.</p> <p>This article is authorized and reproduced by every little d.

As the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, she has chosen a different path from her father, hoping to create her own chapter.</p> <p>Dennis Rodman, who won the NBA rebounding title for seven consecutive seasons, was always in the spotlight during his NBA career due to his rebounding abilities, tattoos, hair color, and behavior. His personal life off the court was also eventful. Trinity Rodman, born to his third wife, was not deeply connected to her father and was primarily raised by her mother. Despite inheriting her father's exceptional athletic genes, Trinity Rodman decided to pursue her passion for soccer. She started playing soccer at the age of 4, joined a youth training club at 10, and achieved remarkable success, winning four national championships. Originally planning to attend Washington State University, her rookie season was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Trinity Rodman decided to join the National Women's Soccer League and was selected by the Washington Spirit as the second overall pick in the first round, becoming the youngest player in the league's history.</p> <p>As a forward on the field, Trinity Rodman has earned accolades for her speed, shooting ability, and game reading skills. Her explosive performance has left a lasting impression on fans, and in January of last year, she was the only rookie invited to the United States women's soccer team training camp among 25 players.</p> <p>Trinity Rodman's on-field performance has been recognized by her team, and last year she signed a four-year contract extension worth $1.1 million with the Washington Spirit, making her the highest-paid player in the United States women's soccer team. Now, she wears the jersey of the United States women's soccer team in the World Cup, aiming for an unprecedented third consecutive victory. On July 22nd, she made her World Cup debut in a match against Vietnam. Despite showcasing her talent on the soccer field, Trinity Rodman often faces questions and discussions about her father, who is a famous NBA star. She once said, \"Many people don't actually know that my father has never played a significant role in my life. Many times, we have different opinions, and I often don't feel his care for months or even years.\"</p> <p>From initially having a passive attitude towards her relationship with her father to seeing him show up at her games and cheer her on, Trinity Rodman has started to find some resolution. She said, \"No matter what, he is my father, and I am his daughter. That will never change.\" Seen as the future core figure of the United States women's soccer team, Trinity Rodman has now learned to accept her last name and takes pride in being a Rodman. She looks forward to creating her own story in the future, where people will refer to her as Trinity Rodman, rather than just Rodman's daughter.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161913978791/","title":"The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals","text":"<p>The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.

The NBA Finals, which follows a 7-game series with the first team to win 4 games, saw the Nuggets return to their home court with a 3-1 advantage over the Heat.</p> <p>Tyler Herro, who averaged 20.1 points per game and was the second-leading scorer for the Heat during the regular season, made a comeback after undergoing surgery for a right hand fracture in the first playoff game against the Milwaukee Bucks.</p> <p>The Heat started the game with a 5-0 run, but the Nuggets quickly responded with a 12-0 run to take the lead. Despite falling behind by 8 points, the Heat managed to regain the lead with consecutive three-pointers from Bam Adebayo, finishing the first quarter with a 24-22 advantage.</p> <p>In the first half, the Nuggets struggled with their three-point shooting, making only 1 out of 15 attempts. Led by Adebayo's 18 points, the Heat maintained a 51-44 lead at halftime.</p> <p>The Nuggets tied the game at 60-60 with a three-pointer from Jamal Murray in the third quarter. The two teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with the Nuggets taking the lead with a three-pointer from Michael Porter Jr., only for the Heat to regain the lead with a three-pointer from Kyle Lowry. After three quarters, the Heat held a slim 71-70 lead.</p> <p>In the final quarter, the Nuggets took the lead after a basket from Jokic and extended it to 7 points. However, the Heat fought back with five consecutive points from Jimmy Butler to regain the lead. With 27 seconds remaining and the Heat trailing 89-90, they made a crucial mistake that resulted in a turnover. The Nuggets capitalized on this and sealed the victory with four made free throws, winning by a margin of 5 points.</p> <p>The Nuggets defeated the Heat 4-1 in the NBA Finals, securing their first NBA championship since joining the league in 1976. In this game, Jokic scored 28 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, while Porter Jr. contributed 16 points and 13 rebounds. Murray added 14 points and 8 assists.</p> <p>For the Heat, five players scored in double digits, with Butler leading the team with 21 points and Adebayo contributing 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat struggled on the boards, being outrebounded 71-50, which proved to be a major disadvantage.</p> <p>Looking back at the Nuggets' history, the team experienced a five-year rebuilding period before emerging as champions under the leadership of Jokic, Murray, and coach Malone. The Nuggets became the second team to win an NBA championship after merging from the ABA (American Basketball Association) into the NBA. The ABA and NBA were in competition until 1976 when the ABA merged with the NBA, leaving only four ABA teams in the NBA, including the Nuggets.</p> <p>The Nuggets, originally known as the Larks and later renamed the Rockets in their first season, became the Nuggets in 1974. They reached the NBA Finals in their last season before the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 but lost to the New York Nets.</p> <p>Throughout their history, the Nuggets have consistently made the playoffs, reaching the postseason in all nine seasons in the ABA. However, they only made it to the NBA Finals once. After joining the NBA, the Nuggets made the playoffs nine times in the 1980s and ten consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2013 but never won the championship.</p> <p>Despite entering a rebuilding phase from the 2013-14 season, the Nuggets quietly laid the foundation for success. The team selected Jokic in 2014, Murray in 2016, and Porter Jr. in 2018 in the NBA Draft. They also hired Malone as the coach in 2015. These moves eventually paid off in the 2018-19 season when the Nuggets finished with a 54-28 record, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.</p> <p>Throughout their 47-year history, the Nuggets have produced several notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. The team has also had coaches like George Karl, known for their offensive style of play in an era dominated by defensive-minded teams.</p> <p>The Nuggets moved to the Pepsi Center in 1999, which is located at an altitude of 5,280 feet. The high altitude and thin air have given the Nuggets a natural home court advantage. Jokic, who was initially slightly overweight when he entered the NBA, transformed his physique and became a dominant force on the court. He has since been recognized as an MVP-caliber player.</p> <p>Jokic, a 28-year-old Serbian center standing at 6 feet 11 inches (approximately 210 cm), was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick. He made an immediate impact in the NBA, earning a spot on the All-Rookie First Team. Despite his initially \"chubby\" appearance compared to other players, Jokic has continuously improved his scoring, averaging 10, 16.7, 18.5, and eventually 20.1 points per game, along with increasing rebound numbers. In the 2019-20 season, he slightly declined with averages of 19.9 points and 9.7 rebounds.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161958798966/","title":"The NBA Spurs won the No","text":"<p>The NBA Spurs won the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft lottery and are likely to select the highly-touted \"French monster\" Victor Wembanyama.

Now, the Rockets are facing a crucial decision that will significantly impact their future - whether to choose stability or aggressiveness.</p> <p>To transition from a rebuilding phase to a competitive team, it is crucial for the Rockets to establish a stable offensive system. Given the chaos the Rockets have experienced in the past four years, it is well-known how Alperen Sengun has been wasted under Stephen Silas. With the appointment of Ime Udoka, the former Celtics head coach who led the team to the NBA Finals, Sengun finally has the opportunity to shine. As a former Celtics coach, Udoka understands the importance of having a center with high-level playmaking abilities on the court. In the previous season, Udoka deliberately utilized Al Horford as a connector at the top of the key, using simple Chicago action plays to create different patterns. He also implemented tactics like Stagger screen and Ram screen to maximize Horford's abilities and value.</p> <p>Playing under Udoka, who values discipline, even star scoring wings like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown do not have the authority to disregard the team's offensive system. This means that Kevin Porter Jr's ball-dominant and uncontrolled habits would be significantly masked. Whether it is playing time or role positioning, Sengun has the opportunity to regain his deserved share. However, things seem to have changed after the July summer league.</p> <p>As the 2021 draft's third overall pick, Jabari Smith Jr (JSJ) has always been expected to become the best companion for Jalen Green. However, his monotonous offensive value as a rookie was not enough to shoulder the responsibilities of a second-in-command. Nevertheless, in the July summer league, JSJ showcased a new side to Rockets fans. Unlike his usual role as a perimeter receiver in the regular season, Jabari Smith Jr took on more ball-handling responsibilities in the summer league, scoring 33 points with 7 rebounds and 38 points with 7 rebounds and 6 assists in two games. His shooting percentages of 48.8/33.3/85.2 were much more efficient than in the regular season. Building on his scoring threat, JSJ even demonstrated his ability to initiate high-level attacks, showcasing his playmaking value as a forward. This has made Sengun's future development more uncertain.</p> <p>The example of Al Horford mentioned earlier actually leaves room for discussion. Since developing his three-point shooting with the Atlanta Hawks in 2015, Horford maintained a level of shooting performance over the following seven seasons. Even though Horford's three-point shooting percentage was a personal low in Udoka's season coaching the Celtics, averaging 3.8 three-point attempts per game with a 33.6% overall three-point shooting percentage and a 35.6% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage is still useful for a center. Horford's value as a perimeter shooter is the key to his versatile role, whether it be pick-and-pop, pop-out after off-screen actions, or spot-up catch-and-shoot opportunities. However, Alperen Sengun only attempted 0.8 three-pointers per game last season with a 33.3% shooting percentage. Although his abilities are limited at this stage, his potential in shooting cannot be ignored. On the other hand, Jabari Smith Jr's shooting prospects are much brighter compared to Sengun's. Stability will be an issue for JSJ to address in the future, but his college career has already shown a high shooting ceiling, and he may even become a better shooter than Horford, able to shoot without being disturbed. This will truly replicate Horford's on-court value.</p> <p>From this, it is evident that the Rockets' biggest challenge at this stage is which offensive system to establish, especially considering the future core of Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore.</p> <p>Option One: Reuse Alperen Sengun and replicate the Grizzlies' model of relying on Steven Adams' high-level impact to maintain offensive stability. This not only gives Sengun the potential to have a similar offensive impact as All-Star Domantas Sabonis in the future but also covers the inconsistent offense of players like Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, concealing their flaws. Similar to how Steven Adams clears the way for Ja Morant and Desmond Bane, this option can provide insurance for the majority of the Rockets' players who are still in the process of realizing their talent.</p> <p>(Note: The original text contains specific player names and photo-related descriptions, which have been removed as per the request.)</p>"},{"location":"20230818162045852903/","title":"The Unforeseen Two Years of Bai Yaocheng's Journey","text":"<p>How many years does it take for one's life to completely turn around?

Following that, he had another opportunity to wear the national team jersey as a member of the Chinese White Team in this year's Jones Cup.</p> <p>\"Never did I imagine that one day I would be a part of the Chinese national team, not even from my days in Yu-Shou University,\" Bai Yaocheng said. Bai Yaocheng's basketball journey is interesting, or rather, the fact that we can discuss his \"basketball journey\" is already surprising. He wasn't initially seen as a talented player. He was just an active kid who played basketball during his free time. In fourth grade, his coach noticed his potential and took him to training. After graduating from elementary school, Bai Yaocheng entered Taichung Fengyang Junior High School, where he became classmates with the \"Fengyang Three Musketeers,\" who had previously competed in the HBL (High School Basketball League). He continued his basketball training from elementary school but suffered a torn meniscus in his knee during practice. Due to the injury and his original lack of interest in basketball, he transferred to Yu-Ying Junior High School, which was closer to home. Bai Yaocheng thought that his basketball journey was over at that point. However, things took a different turn. Despite the injury and his lack of interest, Bai Yaocheng joined the basketball team at Tungshan High School, which seemed like a good compromise for him. Although the Tungshan High School basketball team was not considered a top-tier team and the training was not too rigorous, everything changed when Liao Yinzhong, who was originally coaching the established HBL team from Nanhu High School, became the new coach at Tungshan High School. This greatly altered the plans for Tungshan and Bai Yaocheng. Tungshan specifically brought in Liao Yinzhong, who had years of coaching experience in the HBL, and Liao immediately set the goal for the team to challenge the top-tier HBL division. Bai Yaocheng resisted initially but eventually accepted Liao Yinzhong's arrangement. The subsequent journey was completely different from what Bai Yaocheng had expected. Despite his initial lack of expectations, Bai Yaocheng led Tungshan High School to success in the HBL, reaching the top eight. Then, with Liao Yinzhong's recommendation, he joined the famous basketball program at National Kaohsiung Normal University, where under the guidance of coach Xie Yujuan, Bai Yaocheng gradually grew into the team's playmaker. He also became a member of the \"Tungshan Gang,\" a group of players from Tungshan High School. As the Tungshan Gang became increasingly vital for National Kaohsiung Normal University, Bai Yaocheng and his teammates replaced the previous main sources of players from Sanmin Commercial High School. The three main players from Tungshan High School, Bai Yaocheng, Qiu Zixuan, and Liu Chengyan, not only led National Kaohsiung Normal University to success but also joined the professional league, continuing the legacy of the \"Tungshan Spirit\" in the basketball community.</p> <p>This basketball journey truly changed Bai Yaocheng's life. However, he is not someone who has always had great confidence in himself, whether it be the gap in ambition from the beginning or the intensity he felt on the court. It is not that he lacked talent. It is just that his coaches, from Liao Yinzhong in high school to Xie Yujuan in university, and now Coach Xu Haocheng of the Chinese White Team, all remind him of his offensive abilities and encourage him to be more proactive on the court, not just a pass-first point guard. For Bai Yaocheng, the affirmation from coaches at different levels makes him feel truly trusted and motivated.</p> <p>\"During each transition, I always worry if I can continue to improve and move up. Even after joining National Kaohsiung Normal University, I thought I could only play until the end of college. So, the affirmation from each coach at different stages is crucial to me,\" Bai Yaocheng said.</p> <p>In the Jones Cup, apart from being rested for the game against the United States, Bai Yaocheng started in three out of four games and played over 20 minutes in each game. He clearly plays a vital role as a key substitute in the backcourt for the coaching staff. After coming off the bench in the recent game on August 17th, Bai Yaocheng showcased his speed multiple times, including two impressive drives to the basket. He earned praise from the coaching staff. Despite the Chinese White Team's loss to Qatar with a final score of 59-71, Bai Yaocheng, as a game-changing weapon off the bench, scored the team's highest 11 points, once again earning the trust of the coaching staff. Within two years, he not only stepped onto the professional stage but also played in international games, wearing the \"Chinese\" jersey. Bai Yaocheng describes himself as \"leveling up and defeating monsters.\" These opponents were something he never thought about before. But the fact that the coaches believed in him, as if he successfully cleared a level, gives him an incredible feeling.</p> <p>In terms of talent, Bai Yaocheng may not be the most anticipated player. However, the skills he has accumulated along the way have been enough to receive this affirmation and opportunities to enter the professional league and even represent the national team. Describing it as \"incredible\" may not sound like a self-assessment that a player capable of making the national team would give themselves, but Bai Yaocheng has indeed embarked on a journey that he never expected. For all those who have considered giving up or had no interest but still returned to the path of basketball, perhaps this experience can serve as a reference.</p> <p>However, we already know that Bai Yaocheng, who continues to absorb growth and truly walks the path of basketball, has many challenges waiting for him in the future.

The fact that the JKO Lioneers were willing to give up last year's foreign student, Iboka, for Alasa shows how enticing his potential is.</p> <p>Born in Gambia, Alasa has had a basketball dream that spans over 13,000 kilometers. He started playing basketball at the age of 12 but never received formal training. Relying on his natural talent, he joined the Senegal Premier League at the age of 16. Please continue reading as we always hope to find suitable candidates for the Chinese national team.</p> <p>Alasa possesses good abilities such as talent, height, agility, and wingspan. In the past, we have mostly looked for centers, but why not try finding a power forward instead? After all, training in Africa is highly competitive, and it would be better for him to come to Taiwan to learn.</p> <p>With a height of 205 centimeters and a wingspan of 211 centimeters, Alasa's talent is outstanding. However, he has not yet reached the super elite level required to enter the NBA, so Gambia does not have plans to focus resources on his development.</p> <p>Unable to bear the thought of such a raw talent being buried, three years ago, Hsinchu JKO Lioneers General Manager Gao Jingyan actively recommended him to come to Taiwan for formal basketball training.</p> <p>The JKO Lioneers have been one of my benefactors in Taiwan. Kenny (Gao Jingyan) can be considered my father in Taiwan. Wherever I am, he has given me a lot of help. He really takes care of me, and I am very grateful to him.</p> <p>From arriving in Taiwan, being stuck in Thailand for eight months due to the pandemic, to attending high school and university in Taiwan, and becoming a practice player for the JKO Lioneers in between, Kenny has played an important role in all of it. Although Kenny is no longer the general manager of the JKO Lioneers on the night of the draft, after Alasa found out he was the top pick, he still gave a big hug to Kenny, his \"Taiwanese father.\" Please continue reading as Alasa's hard work, just to \"survive,\" is something I believe local students should learn from.</p> <p>The basketball environment in Taiwan is very comfortable. When training time is up, everyone stops. But you should know that some people continue to work hard to survive while you rest.</p> <p>Because he came to Taiwan, it was not just for himself, but also for the survival of his family. So, every time I see Alasa training and controlling his diet, I feel that local students really need to emulate him.</p> <p>The reason Alasa became the top pick is not only because of his outstanding talent but also because of his hard work. His coach at Taiwan National University of Arts, Li Bolun, mentioned this in a podcast interview. While many people rest, Alasa would go on his own to practice shooting and weight training.</p> <p>For him, the University Basketball Association (UBA) is not his only goal. He aspires to enter a professional basketball league and provide better living conditions for his family in Gambia. This lofty goal allows him to endure rigorous training and demonstrate high levels of discipline and diligence. And behind all of this is the desire to \"survive.\" Alasa has only been playing basketball for two years in Taiwan.</p> <p>I think this level of progress is already significant. In the 110th academic year, Alasa became the scoring champion, rebounding champion, and blocking champion with an average of 19.1 points, 15.2 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game. The following year, his performance evolved even further, with him becoming the scoring champion and rebounding champion with averages of 23.6 points and 17.8 rebounds per game. In a game against Overseas Chinese University of Technology, he achieved a new career-high of 51 points. Looking at the growth in his statistics, it is evident that Alasa has evolved, but he still has weaknesses.</p> <p>Firstly, although he has improved his fundamental skills, his short basketball experience means there is still room for improvement in dribbling, passing, and mid-range shooting.</p> <p>In terms of defense, his matchup against foreign student Mobaye from National Chengchi University highlights Alasa's lack of experience against players who have been training in basketball since childhood. This is one of the reasons why Taiwan National University of Arts was eliminated this year. Please continue reading as there is still a long way to go. Many people have a question: Alasa has indeed performed well at the university level, but can he handle the intensity of a professional league? After all, apart from Pauian Archiland's Landry, the turnover rate of foreign players in PLG has been very high in recent years.</p> <p>I believe one of the reasons, apart from competition for spots, is that at the university level, many foreign players rely on their physique and athleticism to solve problems, which disguises their lack of experience and skills. This may work against local students, but in a professional league, not only is the local competition stronger, but foreign players often have to face taller and more athletic imports, which makes their advantages less prominent.</p> <p>For example, in the past, they could rely on their bodies to push through defenses, but in a professional league, they may not have enough experience and skills to score with other methods. This reduces their threat on the court.</p>"},{"location":"20230818162324025902/","title":"No Longer the Essential Foundation for a Championship, James Harden Now Symbolizes Something Different","text":"<p>Whether James Harden successfully switches teams or stays with the Philadelphia 76ers, he must bring his best game in the upcoming season to show everyone that he is still a valuable player worth investing in   No Longer the Essential Foundation for a Championship, James Harden Now Symbolizes Something Different</p> <p>Whether James Harden successfully switches teams or stays with the Philadelphia 76ers, he must bring his best game in the upcoming season to show everyone that he is still a valuable player worth investing in. After opting into the final year of his contract, Harden requested a trade from the team, leaving everyone curious about his true intentions. Although the 76ers' starting lineup is not perfect, they have a strong overall team.</p> <p>Continuing to read, as long as the reigning MVP Joel Embiid stays healthy, young star Tyrese Maxey continues to improve, Harden showcases his skills, and other players perform consistently, the 76ers have the potential to contend for a championship. Typically, a quasi-Hall of Fame player who is only missing a championship ring would not leave a team like this. However, Harden, who spent seven years as the leader of the Houston Rockets and was an MVP candidate during those years, might leave Philadelphia this summer. If he is traded, it would be his fourth team change in four years. Harden's frequency of team switches is almost comparable to that of his former Thunder teammate Westbrook, despite their contrasting playing styles.</p> <p>Since leaving the Rockets, Harden has been traded to teams that were considered championship contenders, but he has never made it to the NBA Finals. So even if he is traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, a team that is expected to contend, it might not be beneficial for him.</p> <p>Reports indicate that Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey explicitly told Harden that he hoped he would exercise his player option for the final year of his contract. It seems strange that Harden would still request a trade under these circumstances, especially when there is a chance to acquire superstar Damian Lillard through a trade this summer. Perhaps this move is to hold more bargaining power in a potential Harden trade (to improve his trade value by making his relationship with the team appear less strained), and the 76ers still hope that if they continue to work together next season, Harden will be willing to give his all.</p> <p>Continuing to read, theoretically, players should always give their all on the court, but Harden has had a history of displaying a lack of effort.</p> <p>During his final days with the Rockets, he went four consecutive games without scoring more than 20 points. This was something that had never happened in his previous eight years with the Rockets. Even though Harden said in an interview, \"I've given everything I have, and I don't think this situation is unsolvable, it's too crazy,\" it was clear that he wanted the Rockets to trade him.</p> <p>Even if Harden is unable to land on another team, the situation with the 76ers is different from his time with the Rockets. In the new season, we can still expect to see Harden playing seriously because he has no choice.</p> <p>With only one year left on his contract and turning 34 soon, he must give his all on the court. There were rumors that he wanted the team to offer him a long-term and high-paying contract, but reports suggest that the 76ers are not willing to do so, which has left Harden frustrated with the team.</p> <p>Continuing to read, in the upcoming offseason, there may be teams willing to offer him a big contract, similar to the three-year, $126 million deal with a player option in the final year that the Dallas Mavericks offered Kyrie Irving. However, the key is for Harden to give his all in the last year of his current contract so that he can become a coveted player in the market and have a chance to secure a bigger contract.</p> <p>Photos source: Getty Images. There are not many teams in need of a floor general like Harden at his price point, and if he fails to deliver a good performance in the new season or show his determination, there will be almost no teams willing to spend a huge salary to acquire him.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Harden still possesses great skills. Last season, he averaged 21 points per game and became the assist leader with an average of 10.7 assists per game. He should have been selected for the All-Star Game last season, but the team needs him to perform consistently in every game, not just have a few explosive performances, especially during the playoffs.</p> <p>In the second round of last season's playoffs, when Embiid missed the first game, Harden scored an impressive 45 points in a single game. In the fifth game of that series, he scored 42 points. However, excluding these two games, he only scored a total of 67 points in the other six games of the series. The 76ers were heavily defeated in the seventh game against the Celtics, and Harden's stats for that game were 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, with a plus-minus value of -30.</p> <p>Photos source: Getty Images. Looking at Harden's overall performance throughout his career, especially in the playoffs, it becomes clear that he cannot guarantee victory for his team.</p> <p>If he ultimately stays with the 76ers, they will undoubtedly lose out, especially if they have the opportunity to acquire Lillard through a reasonable trade, as Lillard would be a better choice. However, the 76ers might not be able to acquire Lillard in a trade. In such a scenario, the team must not let the situation with Harden become too strained and ensure that he is willing to give his all in the final year of his contract.</p> <p>As for Harden, despite his dissatisfaction with the team, for his personal interests, it is believed that he will still strive to perform well in the new season to earn his next contract.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093456883037/","title":"Chaos in the Chinese men's basketball team: The lack of point guard remains a persistent problem","text":"<p>In the game between the Chinese national team and their opponents in the Jones Cup last night, despite maintaining a lead throughout the game and winning by a 17-point margin, it is undeniable that there were deviations in both offense and defense    Chaos in the Chinese men's basketball team: The lack of point guard remains a persistent problem</p> <p>In the game between the Chinese national team and their opponents in the Jones Cup last night, despite maintaining a lead throughout the game and winning by a 17-point margin, it is undeniable that there were deviations in both offense and defense.</p> <p>With injuries to key backup point guards, Coach Sonny Sandoval decided to have Lin Tingqian and Wu Yongsheng fill in, and even had Zeng Wendong assist from the sidelines. This move was meant to test whether this would become the team's biggest disadvantage in the upcoming Asian Games. Let's analyze further.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Successful recruitment but unexpected injuries became uncontrollable factors. This year, the Chinese team was divided into four groups, utilizing resources from overseas, the three major leagues, and college basketball to successfully form a team with potential and strength. The first-line team, which mainly focuses on preparing for the Asian Games, is the Chinese national team in the Jones Cup. The recruitment process went smoothly, but injuries quietly became a hidden concern, preventing the team from being at full strength. From the exhibition games in Japan to the start of the Jones Cup, injuries to the point guards have been a constant issue. Lin Wei-han underwent surgery and withdrew, Chen Ying-jun underwent surgery and rested, and Li Kai-yan and Zhou Guiyu recently withdrew from training due to injuries. This has affected the overall tactical operation and rhythm control of the team.</p> <p>Although the Chinese team's lineup in the Jones Cup has a good balance of offense and defense, there are still many players who lack experience. From the establishment of the team, it has been evident that they need a leader to take charge. While it is unfortunate that players are getting injured, it is not their fault. It is difficult to compete in a long season without injuries. The severity of the injuries and whether they will affect continuous participation in games are the main concerns. Coach Sonny Sandoval, who has inherited the Charlie Parker system, sees the point guard as the regulator of the team's pace, the most important position outside the paint. The current predicament is evident, and he has expressed in multiple interviews the impact this has brought. We hope that they can recover from their injuries and contribute to the team's success in the Asian Games. Before the Jones Cup, Coach Sandoval mentioned that Lin Tingqian would play the point guard position, with Wu Yongsheng replacing Li Kai-yan and Zhou Guiyu. However, due to the withdrawal of the Olympic men's basketball pre-qualification tournament, Wei Jiahao, Lin Bingsheng, and Zhang Jiahe were added to the team to inject fresh energy into the backcourt, hoping to achieve the desired results in the games.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Switching the ball-dominant axis for an activating effect and achieving four consecutive wins. Fans can read the article \"The Overlay Effect of the New and Old Systems: The Influence Brought by Coach Sonny Sandoval\" on the website, which discusses the system operation of the Chinese national team in the Jones Cup. Since the exhibition games in Japan, the biggest change has been the shift in the ball-dominant core, from focusing on the backcourt to achieving a balance. This allows players in the fourth and fifth positions to have the ball in their hands, with the frontcourt running and creating offensive opportunities or stretching the defense to attack the rim. This helps alleviate the pressure of lacking a point guard.</p> <p>In the first four games, Lin Tingqian and Wu Yongsheng played the point guard position, while Zeng Wendong acted as the invisible playmaker. They each had three assists in two games, leaving the rhythm of the game in their hands.</p> <p>Looking at the performances of the Chinese team in each game, in the first game against the Philippines, they recorded 24 assists, mostly concentrated in the backcourt and on Li Dewei. The main focus was on fast breaks and half-court offensive strategies. In the second game against Japan, Wu Yongsheng took charge of the point guard position, but the frontcourt had strong offensive energy, running fast and attracting double teams to create open shots. Liu Zheng and Abass combined for 10 assists, proving that both teams were not strong, and they didn't face many difficulties.</p> <p>In the game against Qatar two days ago, Lin Tingqian and Zeng Wendong took control of the ball. They used pick-and-roll plays and high-low positioning, allowing Atyanov to shoot with a 75% field goal percentage. Lin Tingqian scored in the first half and assisted in the second half, stabilizing the offensive and defensive rhythm and preventing the opponent's counterattacks. Yesterday's game against Iran was chaotic, with a total of 16 assists, the lowest in the four games. Apart from Zeng Wendong's solid half-court play, most of the offense relied on strong attacks from the frontcourt. The ball movement was not smooth, and there were even moments where it was hard to see any organization, resulting in deviations in the game. From the above observations, it can be seen that the Chinese team no longer heavily relies on the point guard for ball possession and offense. Instead, they focus on strong defense and transitioning from offense to defense. They develop their offense in two areas: the backcourt and pick-and-roll plays with Atyanov, as well as high-low positioning in the paint. In terms of assists, fast breaks are still more prominent than half-court plays. Depending on the opponent and the lineup, the ball-dominant axis is distributed across different positions, showcasing a versatile lineup.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Individual breakthroughs are still stronger than group collaboration, and half-court offense is not easy to execute. First and foremost, it must be emphasized that the teams in the Jones Cup are not top-tier, so it is not difficult for the Chinese team to win. Therefore, the focus should be on the content of the games and how the team adjusts as a whole. Indeed, without a strong point guard on the court, the organization and system heavily rely on the players' performance on that day. If they are playing well, they can control the rhythm, but if not, it can become chaotic. This is the dilemma facing the Chinese team. (1) Is it a waste to have Lin Tingqian play as a point guard? Lin Tingqian is the best physically conditioned player among the top three in the CBA. He has a variety of offensive moves and is strong in one-on-one situations. He can be considered the Chinese team's most powerful weapon. While he mainly plays as a shooting guard in the league, he also has experience playing as a point guard. However, organizing the team is not his natural inclination. Therefore, playing him as a point guard is a last resort. Coach Sonny Sandoval mentioned that it was a difficult decision but a relatively secure configuration. I support this decision, as there are no other options and Lin Tingqian's ability to play as a combo guard would be beneficial for his future development. By not solely focusing on offense and expanding the team's effectiveness, the key is to find the right balance between his attack and organization skills to maximize his impact.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093538507157/","title":"Terror balance with a heavy head and light feet, three problems to watch in the recent Sun's trading of Bol Bol for Cam Payne and collecting second-round picks","text":"<p>Terror balance with a heavy head and light feet, three problems to watch in the recent Sun's trading of Bol Bol for Cam Payne and collecting second-round picks.</p> <p>The Suns have been one of the most active teams during the offseason, making headlines with the Bradley Beal trade rumors. After the start of the free agency period, they have also signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon. They have also reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee.</p> <p>With their roster taking shape for the new season, the Suns have been making adjustments through signings and trades. First, they sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently waived by the Magic, in a trade involving draft picks.</p> <p>Bol Bol, like Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out with his unique physical attributes. Standing at 7'2\" (218cm) with a wingspan of 7'8\" (234cm), Bol possesses a versatile skill set similar to this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama (7'4\" tall with a 7'10\" wingspan). This has earned him the nickname \"Original Wembanyama.\"</p> <p>Last season, Bol had his best performance since entering the league four years ago. In 70 games played, he averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game, all career highs. However, his performance fluctuated throughout the season.</p> <p>In the first two and a half months of the season, Bol played 37 games, starting in 32 of them and averaging 26.1 minutes per game. He contributed an average of 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and shot 58.8% from the field. But as the Magic's injured players Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned in 2023, Bol's playing time and production decreased. In the next 33 games, he only started in one game and averaged 10 minutes less on the court, resulting in 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game.</p> <p>The most significant impact of the inconsistent playing time was seen in Bol's three-point shooting. In the first two and a half months, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%. However, in 2023, it dropped to a dismal 8.6%.</p> <p>Despite this, Bol remains a unique player when looking at advanced statistics. His height and smooth shooting touch make him difficult to stop on cuts to the basket, ranking him in the top 5% in efficiency. His height and wingspan also give him an advantage in offensive rebounding, with a top 5% efficiency in putbacks.</p> <p>Bol's excellent ball-handling skills allow him to drive the ball on his own during fast breaks, making decisions based on the defense's positioning. He can either take it to the rim or make a quick stop-and-pop three-pointer. His transition offense accounted for 27.6% of his overall offensive contributions last season, ranking him 15th in the league, higher than any other Suns player.</p> <p>Unlike most big men who act as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol, with his versatile ball-handling skills, can also act as the ball handler. In today's positionless basketball trend, where big men handle the ball and forwards and guards can play multiple positions, Bol stands out as the number one among 7' tall players in pick-and-roll ball handling, accounting for 8.6% of his overall offensive contributions.</p> <p>In summary, Bol Bol's all-around abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing make him a valuable piece in the coach's tactical adjustments on the offensive end. However, his impact on defense may not be as significant due to his thin frame despite his towering height. Within 6 feet of the rim, opponents' shooting percentage actually increases by 1.1% when defended by Bol, ranking him seventh from the bottom among all 7' tall players in the league last season.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093601114518/","title":"What level is the Chinese Blue team in the NCAA Jones Cup, and how can the UC Irvine coach defeat most mid-tier teams?","text":"<p>The head coach of UC Irvine, Russell Turner, led his team to a 95-80 victory over the Chinese Blue team in the recent Jones Cup tournament    What level is the Chinese Blue team in the NCAA Jones Cup, and how can the UC Irvine coach defeat most mid-tier teams?</p> <p>The head coach of UC Irvine, Russell Turner, led his team to a 95-80 victory over the Chinese Blue team in the recent Jones Cup tournament. The question of the disparity between Asian and American teams has sparked discussions. Where does the national team's level stand in the NCAA Division I basketball league in the United States? Coach Russell Turner first responded to the game by expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to come to Taiwan and participate in the Jones Cup. He was amazed by the atmosphere at the venue and the dedication of Taiwanese fans who cheered for the teams. The Chinese team took the lead in the first quarter, which could have easily knocked them out. Regarding his team's counterattack, Coach Turner described them as playing like a championship team. The players showed great determination to win this game and emphasized the importance they placed on the Jones Cup. He believes that their ability to win the championship in this tournament is due to the team's depth and athleticism, which align well with the format of the Jones Cup. When asked about how Asian teams perform in NCAA Division I, Coach Turner stated that his team is also strong.

The Chinese Blue team, according to Coach Turner, is a highly competitive team in NCAA Division I and can defeat most mid-tier universities. On certain days, they can even win against strong opponents because of their good teamwork. He praised the team's organizers and coaching staff for showcasing the team's strengths.

The Chinese White Team's last victory was a week ago, so their goal for today was to end the tournament on a high note with another win.</p> <p>The Chinese White Team carried their momentum from yesterday's game against the South Korean Team and performed better both offensively and defensively than in their previous games. They took a 12-6 lead with contributions from Ma Jianhao, Chen Fan Boyan, and Hong Kaijie.

Please continue reading on Instagram to see the full story.</p> <p>Lin Bingsheng, who has a significant presence on Instagram, continuously reposted the well wishes from Central Bank fans who bid him farewell after announcing the end of his relationship with the team. However, it was noticed that he had not reposted the \"Welcome\" message from his \"new team,\" which was quite unusual and raised suspicions among sensitive fans.</p> <p>Then, at noon on the 16th, Lin Bingsheng posted on his Instagram, thanking everyone for their concern and blessings, as well as expressing gratitude to the Lioneers for the opportunity. He explained that due to personal career planning considerations, he had repeatedly expressed thanks and apologies but declined to join the team.</p> <p>This post was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, igniting the atmosphere in Taiwan's basketball community and leaving people breathless.</p> <p>Around two in the afternoon, while fans and media were still speculating about the \"truth\" between the Lioneers and Lin Bingsheng, the Lioneers, feeling betrayed, issued a statement saying they would \"seek legal means to defend the team's rights.\" They also shared a screenshot of the \"appointment contract\" signed by both parties, clearly showing the company seal and the signatures of the representatives.</p> <p>As the situation unfolded, Lin Bingsheng was attacked and ridiculed by many fans for allegedly breaching his contract and attempting to switch teams with a gun.</p> <p>The actions of the new T1 team, Taipei Taishin, which was speculated to be involved in the raid, also received criticism from many fans. The Lioneers directly labeled this behavior as \"malicious poaching of contracted players.\"</p> <p>In this drama of Taiwanese basketball, where the line between appointment and employment is blurred, it is rare to have the opportunity to see the actual signatures of players on contracts. However, the use of the term \"appointment contract\" by the Lioneers is perplexing.</p> <p>Article 549 of the Civil Code explicitly states that \"either party to the appointment contract may terminate the contract at any time. If one party terminates the contract during a period unfavorable to the other party, they shall be liable for damages. However, if the termination is not attributable to that party, it is not subject to this limitation.\" Some argue that this means the contract between Lin Bingsheng and the Lioneers can be terminated at any time, so the poaching behavior may indeed be valid.</p> <p>However, in the practical interpretation of Taiwanese courts, the determination is not solely based on the wording of the contract. In 2015, after a dispute with a spectator on the sidelines, the Fubon Braves unilaterally terminated their multi-year contract with Zheng Renwei, citing \"improper behavior damaging the team's image.\" Zheng Renwei disagreed and filed a lawsuit with the court to \"confirm the existence of the contract.\"</p> <p>At the end of the \"appointment contract\" publicly released by the Hsinchu JKO Lioneers, the signatures of the representative of Party A and the handwritten signature of Lin Bingsheng can be clearly seen. Source: PLG Hsinchu JKO Lioneers.</p> <p>The court stated that the contract clearly demonstrated \"the unique personality, organizational, and economic subordination inherent in an employment relationship,\" and that there was a continuous provision of services in exchange for remuneration, with the team having complete control and supervision. Therefore, the contract could not be automatically regarded as an appointment contract based solely on its wording. Instead, it was determined that there was a continuous employment relationship between the two parties. The court ruled against the Fubon team, stating that Zheng Renwei's actions did not reach the level of direct termination, and there was a risk of abuse of power.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093649125950/","title":"Gabe Norwood's Journey in the 2023 Jones Cup: A Trip Down Memory Lane","text":"<p>Although his face still appears very young, this slender man who continues to run on the court with full force is already 38 years old, undoubtedly a player who can be called a \"veteran\" in basketball    Gabe Norwood's Journey in the 2023 Jones Cup: A Trip Down Memory Lane</p> <p>Although his face still appears very young, this slender man who continues to run on the court with full force is already 38 years old, undoubtedly a player who can be called a \"veteran\" in basketball. This is Gabe Norwood, a well-known Filipino-American player and former member of the Philippine national team. This year, he was invited to Taiwan again with the Elasto Painters team for the PBA single-team nature of the Jones Cup, which is being held again after a three-year suspension. Taiwan is not a strange term or place for Norwood. He has participated in the Jones Cup three times, but the most recent time was in 2015, 8 years ago. The first time he came to Taiwan and put on the Philippines national team \"Gilas\" jersey was in 2007, a remarkable 16 years ago. \"A few days ago when we played against Chinese Taipei, I looked at the Hsu brothers (Hsu Dan, Hsu Po) and thought, 'When I first came to Taiwan, I was their age. I was running and jumping just like them,'\" Norwood said. Please continue reading (Image source: Basketball Association provided). </p> <p>Norwood grew up in the United States and moved several times due to his father being a member of a coaching staff in American football. He later attended George Mason University, and in the 2006 NCAA tournament, George Mason made a surprising \"Cinderella\" run to the Final Four, completing the most amazing journey in NCAA history. Although George Mason was not a bottom-seeded team in the tournament, they were ranked 11th seed and defeated top-ranked schools such as Michigan State, North Carolina, Wichita State, and Connecticut. They eventually lost to the champion, the University of Florida, in the Final Four. This was George Mason's first and only time reaching the Final Four, a memory that Norwood still cherishes. </p> <p>\"We didn't have a single NBA player, zero,\" Norwood said. He mainly served as the sixth man, but none of his George Mason teammates went on to play in the NBA. Jai Lewis, their strong center, even became a member of the NFL after failing to be selected in the 2006 NBA draft. However, they defeated players like Maurice Ager, Paul Davis, Shannon Brown, Danny Green, Tyler Hansbrough, Hilton Armstrong, Josh Boone, Marcus Williams, and Rudy Gay, who were highly regarded in college and later had NBA careers. The team that eventually defeated them, the University of Florida, was led by well-known NBA players Joakim Noah, Al Horford, and Corey Brewer. \"Being able to compete against and even defeat so many future NBA players with a lineup that didn't have any NBA players is something I can always proudly talk about and remember,\" Norwood said. After finishing his NCAA career, Norwood immediately returned to the Philippines. His experience in the United States made him highly valued by the national team, and he quickly became a member of the national team's training and official roster. In 2008, he joined the Elasto Painters team as the first overall pick and has remained with the team for his 15-year career. </p> <p>In 2007, he was first selected for the national team and played in his first Jones Cup. \"At that time, I felt it was a great honor to wear the Philippines national team jersey and participate in international competitions overseas. I was valued by the coaches, went through many classic battles, and came to the Jones Cup, playing eight to nine games in a row with at most one day of rest. Every day, I experienced the impact of different countries and different basketball cultures, and every game made me feel meaningful,\" Norwood said. Please continue reading. </p> <p>Today (August 16th) is the fifth day of the tournament, and after suffering defeats in the first four days, the Philippines finally defeated Iran in double-overtime, achieving their first victory in this Jones Cup. Norwood was sent onto the court during the critical moments of the second overtime by coach Joseller Guiao to complete important defensive tasks, stopping Iran's comeback attempt. Coach Guiao highly appreciated Norwood's contribution, saying, \"He is a seasoned player with leadership abilities who fully understands what needs to be done on the court. When we needed defense during crucial moments, he was able to step up and defend. I trust him a lot.\" Although Norwood may not be the absolute mainstay player with extended playing time in this Jones Cup, he is still an indispensable veteran for the Philippines. </p> <p>Norwood has excellent physical talent, excelling in both offense and defense. He is almost a guaranteed selection for the national team, a reliable 3D player. He won silver medals with the Philippines in the 2013 and 2015 FIBA Asia Championships (now Asia Cup), achieving the team's best records and advancing to the FIBA World Cup and Olympic qualification tournaments. He has left his mark in Philippine basketball history and has not forgotten the intense battle with the Chinese Taipei team in the 2013 Asia Championships: \"I will always remember that year. We had a good performance, but we lost to Taiwan in one game. However, looking back, it was a very exciting game. We had a double-digit lead in the second half, but we were eventually overturned by a sharpshooter from the Chinese Taipei team (Lu Cheng-Ju). I believe it was a fantastic showdown where both sides gave their all. As a player, losing may be disappointing, but there is absolutely no regret,\" Norwood said.

After a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jones Cup has returned this year. The University of California Irvine (UCI), representing the United States, was invited to participate. Turner, who has been in charge of UCI since 2010, has once again set foot on the island. When Turner mentioned his previous visit to \"this place,\" he was referring to 27 years ago in 1996. In that year, the Jones Cup also featured a team from the United States, composed of stars from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of the NCAA. At the time, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University and accompanied the American team to Taiwan.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Due to his previous participation in the Jones Cup, Turner has a deep understanding of the tournament's dynamics and schedule. Although it may not be a formal championship with points and official records, having teams from various Asian countries participate is still a special and meaningful challenge for NCAA teams. \"Playing 8 games in 9 days is just as intense as playing 11 games in 12 days, which was the case back then. It's a demanding schedule that puts us to the test. In mid-August, many universities in the United States have already started a new semester, but UCI is still on vacation due to scheduling arrangements, making it the perfect opportunity for us to challenge ourselves before the start of the school year.\"</p> <p>About two months before the start of the Jones Cup, UCI had already announced on the university's website that their basketball team would be participating. The NCAA allows each school to have an international program once every four years, and UCI chose the Jones Cup as their journey. \"Many people in the United States only watch American basketball,\" Turner said. \"Although the United States is undoubtedly the best basketball country in the world, basketball is not limited to one style. NCAA players need to learn about basketball with different styles, talents, and strategies from different countries in order to understand how basketball operates.\"</p> <p>Although UCI started the Jones Cup with three consecutive victories, scoring over 100 points and winning by more than 60 points each game, Turner believes that this does not mean they are a powerhouse far superior to other teams, nor does it mean that UCI considers the Jones Cup to be unchallenging. \"Many of our players are seeing how Asian teams play for the first time. In fact, teams like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates improved as the tournament went on. The content of our loss on the first day may not reflect their true strength. We just had enough manpower this time to change our strategies according to the situation on the court. We performed well in the Jones Cup, even better than I expected, and that's why we won.\"</p> <p>UCI brought 17 players to the Jones Cup this time. Turner mentioned that they usually maintain a roster of 16 players for the school team. Bringing an extra player this time was necessary to meet the depth requirements for intensive games and to adapt tactics against different countries. Among the six players above 205 centimeters, four are over 210 centimeters. Turner initially planned to have at least two of them on the court at all times, maintaining a \"twin tower\" formation. However, he changed the lineup to a formation with one big and four small players when he believed that spatial awareness and defensive presence in the paint were more important. \"My forwards also performed well and lived up to my expectations when I changed the formation. That's the best part of our performance.\"</p> <p>Over twenty years ago, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University. He then moved to Stanford from 2000 to 2004 and joined the NBA's Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach in 2004. In 2010, he left the NBA and became the head coach of UCI. For him, although the title of head coach is higher than that of an assistant coach, the educational significance that college basketball brings is more important than professional basketball.</p> <p>\"Compared to professional basketball, college coaches have a greater influence on players. College players may not be mature, but college coaches don't necessarily have to immediately help players secure better contracts. Instead, they can help them grow from boys to better men through their presence on the court. Of course, in college, I still need to help the team win. However, if I can help players become better individuals and bring more positive influences to themselves and their surroundings, that would be my achievement as a college coach.\"</p> <p>In Turner's philosophy, winning is undoubtedly important in basketball. Whether it's his original twin tower formation or the tallest starting lineup in NCAA history, which had a 7'6\" player and a 6'8\" player in the same game in 2015, Turner wants to convey to his players that basketball is not just about winning. \"When I first came to UCI, none of the players on the team were taller than me (6'7\"). We played fast, just like Asian teams. Now, I usually use two big players, and we can still win. What I want to say is that basketball will always be related to physique and skills. Having a better physique or better skills than others can give you an advantage. But the most beautiful thing on the basketball court is that there are always different ways to improve. As long as you focus on your path to success, you can make great things happen.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230821093745794049/","title":"Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team in the series against the Los Angeles Lakers","text":"<p>Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team in the series against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Prior to this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect record of 19 wins and 0 losses against Western Conference teams in the playoffs. This means that whenever the Warriors made it to the playoffs, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won the championship four times.</p> <p>Despite finishing 6th in the regular season and avoiding the play-in tournament, the Warriors had a tough first-round series against the Sacramento Kings, which went to a decisive Game 7. Looking at the Warriors' core rotation, it is unlikely that they would trade their star player Stephen Curry, whose contract runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the \"Splash Brothers,\" could potentially be a target for the team.</p> <p>According to reports from the US sports media, next year will be the last year of Thompson's contract with the Warriors, earning a salary of $43.21 million. Although the Warriors have the option to re-sign him, there are rumors that the team wants Thompson to take a pay cut.</p> <p>Furthermore, according to The Athletic, although Draymond Green has a player option for the next season, he must decide by June 30, 2023, whether to exercise it. While the Warriors are interested in re-signing Green, it is uncertain if they will offer him a max contract. If Green becomes a free agent, there are several teams interested in acquiring him.</p> <p>In addition to the main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only averaged 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, expressed his desire to be traded to a team where he can have more opportunities, according to his agent.</p> <p>In the Western Conference semifinals, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, with a final score of 122-101. They will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers had a 3-2 advantage before the game, and they outperformed the Warriors in various aspects. LeBron James had 30 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists, while Anthony Davis contributed 17 points and 20 rebounds despite leaving the game due to an injury. Austin Reaves scored 23 points, shooting 4 out of 5 from three-point range, leading the Lakers throughout the game. Despite Stephen Curry's game-high 32 points, Klay Thompson struggled, and the Warriors only made 13 of their 48 three-point attempts.</p> <p>The Lakers took a slight lead of 31-26 in the first quarter and continued to dominate in the second quarter, with the Warriors struggling to find their shooting rhythm. The \"Splash Brothers,\" Curry and Thompson, only scored a combined 20 points in the first half. The Lakers, on the other hand, were led by LeBron James, who scored 15 points in the first half, including a three-pointer. Austin Reaves hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer from beyond half-court before halftime, energizing the crowd and giving the Lakers a 56-46 lead. In the second half, the Lakers extended their lead with more three-pointers from Reaves and a contribution from D'Angelo Russell.</p> <p>The Warriors, who have had a poor away record this season, struggled in the third quarter. With 6 minutes and 20 seconds remaining in the third quarter, both teams received technical fouls after a confrontation under the basket, resulting in the ejection of the Lakers' Dennis Schroder. The Lakers entered the fourth quarter with a 91-77 lead, and although the Warriors showed some improvement, Draymond Green faced foul trouble, and Rui Hachimura blocked Klay Thompson's shot. With more than 8 minutes left in the fourth quarter, there was already a 20-point difference between the teams, securing the victory for the Lakers. The 7th-seeded Lakers, who eliminated the 2nd-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in the first round, will face the top-seeded Denver Nuggets on the 17th of this month.

Fortunately, he was quickly rushed to the hospital and is now out of the intensive care unit, with no major issues.</p> <p>However, this incident may jeopardize the progress he has made so far. As the son of LeBron, Bronny has always faced more attention and pressure than the average \"baller son\". Being the \"heir apparent\" to a legendary figure in the NBA, his basketball talent is naturally scrutinized. However, compared to his father's high school days, Bronny's dominance on the court is not as remarkable. Although he still possesses good natural abilities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance as his father did in high school. At one point, he was even considered to be living in his father's shadow.</p> <p>Nevertheless, despite the harsh criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior year, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning a spot on the McDonald's All-American team and receiving the title of a five-star high school player from some basketball media outlets. He also received basketball scholarships from several top NCAA Division I schools. These achievements significantly raised his draft prospects, going from a potential undrafted player to someone with a chance to be selected in the first round or even in the lottery. Some may attribute this to the influence of his father's fame, as LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, he has a high chance of joining his son's team and playing alongside him. This \"son picks father\" scenario undoubtedly had an impact on Bronny's market value, but it should not overshadow his own efforts.</p> <p>Ultimately, Bronny chose to attend the University of Southern California and intends to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to his enrollment, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove his doubters wrong. However, his heart condition has cast a shadow over his upcoming college season.</p> <p>Bronny's case, where his NBA journey was hindered by a heart problem, reminds me of another \"baller son,\" Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. During his high school years, Shareef indeed had some notable performances and was recognized as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, a heart abnormality was discovered, which posed a high risk to his life and necessitated immediate surgery.</p> <p>The post-surgery recovery and rehabilitation forced Shareef to stay away from high-intensity competitions for a whole 11 months. This was a significant setback for a rising player since he missed out on crucial development opportunities. Coupled with Shareef's condition, which made him less dominant in the more intense NCAA games, coaches did not have the luxury of giving him much time on the court, resulting in a decline in his college performance. Ultimately, he faced the possibility of going undrafted.</p> <p>\"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me.\" \"I want him to play his own game, his own style.\" \"Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the O'Neal name, but he still has to create his own path,\" Shaquille said. </p> <p>Currently, Shareef is still pursuing opportunities in professional leagues. Despite averaging only 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the previous season, overcoming the shadow of his heart condition is a significant achievement. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be defined by his father's achievements and reputation but to courageously pursue his own chosen path.</p> <p>Likewise, LeBron undoubtedly views Bronny in the same way, where his draft position or any potential setbacks will not diminish the love LeBron has for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and can showcase his own value in the upcoming season.</p> <p>This article, authorized by the author, was originally published here.

Artino officially joined the team and began representing Taiwan in the first and second rounds of the 2023 FIBA World Cup Asia Qualifiers and the 2022 Asia Cup. With Artino's addition, the team's strength has indeed been improved to a certain extent. However, due to the relatively short cooperation time and the differences in Artino's strengths compared to Davis, there seems to be room for improvement in Artino's integration into the team compared to Davis' first year with the team.</p> <p>Continuing to read about this year's 2023 Jones Cup, it is Artino's first time playing in Taiwan wearing the Chinese national team jersey in front of the Taiwanese people. The Jones Cup holds a special meaning for many Taiwanese basketball fans, and performing well in front of them can deepen the connection with the fans. Additionally, the intense schedule of 9 days and 8 games, facing teams with different playing styles from around the world, also helps in the integration between Artino and the Chinese men's basketball team. Continuing to read about the 2023 Jones Cup, Artino, along with his teammates Hu Jiaxiong, Lin Zhijie, Abasi, and Aba, all have different connections to Taiwan. Apart from the undefeated University of California, Irvine, the overall strength of the other countries' lineups is not as high as in previous years. Therefore, the individual performances of the players may not hold much value, and the focus will be on observing the chemistry between the players. However, Artino has indeed performed well in this year's Jones Cup. Continuing to read, in this edition of the Jones Cup, Artino played in all 8 games, averaging 26.24 minutes per game and contributing an average of 21.4 points, 10.5 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. His plus-minus value reached an impressive 14.4, and this excellent performance earned him a spot in the All-Tournament Team.</p> <p>Notably, Artino's field goal percentage for two-pointers reached an impressive 71.7%, indicating his dominance in the paint during this Jones Cup. Furthermore, he has improved in avoiding fouls, committing an average of only 1.9 fouls per game. However, there is still room for improvement in his free throw shooting, as he averaged 5.8 attempts per game but only achieved a 63% free throw percentage. Artino expressed that playing in the Jones Cup feels different from playing in professional leagues in the past, and he feels great to be able to wear the Chinese national team jersey and play in front of Taiwanese fans.</p> <p>In addition, the team's chemistry has improved compared to previous years. This year is Artino's first time training with the national team, and if Yi Jianjun can successfully return to the team, Artino believes that their team's strength will be even more complete.</p> <p>Recently becoming a father, Artino mentioned that this change in his life has given him a different perspective: \"This year, I became a father, but at the same time, I lost my own father. My father loved watching me play basketball, and I know he is now watching me from another world. I want my child to grow up in Taiwan and experience its culture. I hope that one day, he can serve the national team just like me.\"</p> <p>This year, the Chinese national team has a new coach, Coach Sam Mortensen, replacing Coach Parker, who had been coaching for many years. Regarding the adaptation to the coaching systems of the two coaches, Artino said, \"The systems of the two coaches are indeed slightly different, but I think both of them are great coaches. My job is to fulfill any tasks given by the coach. The most important job for me is to protect the paint and score for the Chinese national team as much as possible.\" From losing his father to becoming a father, this significant transformation in life has given Artino a different understanding of basketball. After settling down in Taiwan, his growing ambition and emotional investment in the game are qualities that cannot be taken away. Whether he can channel these qualities in the right direction and bring positive contributions to the team will test Artino's wisdom as he enters this new stage of life.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132252100297/","title":"Temporary Stagnation in the Eye of the Free Agent Market Storm","text":"<p>For more articles, join the \"Bulls Fans Discussion Group\" or visit the new \"AhUtopian Sports Talk\" page   Temporary Stagnation in the Eye of the Free Agent Market Storm</p> <p>For more articles, join the \"Bulls Fans Discussion Group\" or visit the new \"AhUtopian Sports Talk\" page.

It could be related to the injury exception they applied for.</p> <ol> <li>Andre Drummond's Revelation: A recent video of Drummond has been widely circulated, where he advises young players not to focus solely on statistics and complain, but rather on becoming better team players. This advice resonates with Drummond's own experience, going from a player with a multi-million-dollar contract to someone who struggled to find a team.</li> </ol> <p>Drummond's speech to young players during his time with the Bulls has been meaningful for his self-awareness and mindset, making him willing to stay with the team.</p> <p>During a period when he wasn't playing, there were rumors that Drummond faced self-doubt and questioning, and the coaching staff and organization chose to support him. If you watch the video, you can see the reasons behind the team's approach and the impact it had. It's a lesson in life and broadening perspectives.</p> <ol> <li>Signing Julian Phillips with the New CBA Second Round Exception: According to reports, the Bulls have signed Julian Phillips, the 35th overall pick in this year's draft, to a four-year contract. The contract includes team options and provides Phillips with a guaranteed amount of $5.7 million, making it the second-highest among second-round picks.</li> </ol> <p>Under the CBA, these four-year contracts with second-round picks require teams to decline the fourth-year option after the third year to make the player a restricted free agent. This is similar to previous CBA regulations. Notable cases under the previous CBA include Lu Dort, who had a successful outcome, and Jalen Brunson, whose team failed to exercise the option.</p> <ol> <li>Signing Adama Sanogo to a Two-Way Contract: The Bulls have confirmed the signing of undrafted rookie Adama Sanogo to a two-way contract. Sanogo has shown his strengths and weaknesses during the summer league, and he reminds me of Isaiah Stewart, a recently signed center for the Detroit Pistons. Stewart secured a $64 million, four-year extension with the Pistons.</li> </ol> <p>While I haven't watched Stewart's games extensively, besides his confrontation with LeBron James, his basketball IQ, development, and role have been subjects of discussion among Pistons fans. However, the Pistons evaluated him positively and provided him with an opportunity amidst competition from high-ceiling players like Marvin Bagley III and James Wiseman. Even though the market for traditional centers may be shrinking in today's game, players like Kevon Looney, Wendell Carter Jr., and Steven Adams have proven that by understanding their roles and positively impacting the game through team integration, they can still be recognized.</p> <p>Note: All references to specific social media pages and groups have been removed as per the request.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132330120684/","title":"NBA player Skal Labissiere has signed a partially guaranteed one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, according to reporter Shams Charania","text":"<p>NBA player Skal Labissiere has signed a partially guaranteed one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, according to reporter Shams Charania.

It is expected that Labissiere will spend most of his time in the G-League while the Kings evaluate his performance and potentially promote him to the main roster. Labissiere was selected by the Kings as the 28th overall pick in the first round of the 2016 NBA Draft. He averaged 8.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game in his rookie season and had similar numbers the following year. However, his playing time decreased significantly after being traded to the Trail Blazers in the 2018-2019 season.

The first season depicted the rise of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s, led by the flamboyant and charismatic owner Jerry Buss (played by John C. Reilly). The team was known for their entertaining style of play and was nicknamed Showtime.</p> <p>However, the series also portrayed the darker aspects of the glamorous era - sex, drugs - which led some of the real-life characters to publicly criticize the show for distorting reality.</p> <p>Continuing reading, how many key characters are there in the series? This includes Magic Johnson (played by Quincy Isaiah), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (played by Solomon Hughes), and coach West (played by Jason Clarke).</p> <p>Coach West even publicly demanded an apology from HBO for the distorted portrayal of his character. In the series, Magic Johnson is still portrayed as a talented and spiritual player, but much attention is given to his rampant sexuality and affairs with different women. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, still in his prime, is depicted as a washed-up, jealous, and difficult former star. As for coach West, he is constantly smashing things and using foul language, showing no signs of stability or composure. </p> <p>The second season of the Lakers dynasty's rise in the TV series trailer enters the period after Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar led the team to win the 1980 NBA championship, forming a dynasty with a new style of play and a fast-paced dominance in the NBA league. The Showtime Lakers went on to win five championships, helping the NBA grow into a multi-billion dollar sports industry.</p> <p>Continuing reading, the second season covers the period from 1980 to 1984, where the Lakers won their first championship but then faced elimination. The series explores what happens after achieving ambitions, especially why it becomes so difficult to win again after the first time. Max Borenstein says, \"You will find that those who achieve their goals will stand in front of the mirror, doubting themselves, and wondering what to do next. What is the next step?\" From 1982 onwards, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals eight out of ten years, which was an incredible era.</p> <p>However, behind the ups and downs of their performance, there are stories. In 1982, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers led by Julius Erving, only to be swept by their old rivals in 1983.</p> <p>In 1984, the Lakers finally faced the Boston Celtics and Larry Bird (played by Sean Patrick Small) in the NBA Finals. To create dramatic storytelling, the script may not fully adhere to the actual events. Making a basketball-themed drama believable also requires a lot of effort. Producer Idan Ravin has helped with the basketball-related preparations in the past, including casting and choreography.</p> <p>The challenge is that not many actors have the same height and athleticism as NBA players, making it difficult for them to perform high-level moves.</p> <p>That's why when Idan Ravin received a call from HBO's production unit asking him to \"turn a professional actor into Magic Johnson,\" he burst out laughing.</p> <p>Idan Ravin said, \"The NBA has 400 registered players today, and none of them can become Magic Johnson, but HBO wants me to train an actor to become Magic Johnson?\" Continuing reading, Quincy Isaiah, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall, already stands out in Hollywood, but he is still 6 inches shorter than Magic Johnson. Additionally, his muscular physique from playing American football makes him look bulky on camera. Therefore, Idan Ravin helped him develop a weight loss plan to make his appearance closer to Magic Johnson. To make his basketball playing look professional, Idan Ravin had Quincy Isaiah undergo special training, especially in learning Magic Johnson's famous no-look passes, accurately bouncing the ball to his teammates.</p> <p>Executive producer and one of the writers, Rodney Barnes, said that the challenge was to present how Johnson's interactions with his teammates were dramatic, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the storyline. In the second season, Pat Riley (played by Adrien Brody) officially becomes the Lakers' head coach after his friend West is fired. This is described by Max Borenstein as a \"Shakespearean\" transformation, as if a superhero emerges, with Pat Riley's Armani suits symbolizing a cape and his hair styled with gel symbolizing a mask, coming to the rescue of the Lakers. Another key character in the series is Jeanie Buss (played by Hadley Robinson), Jerry Buss's daughter and the current owner of the Lakers.</p> <p>In reality, Jeanie Buss herself expressed her opinion on Instagram after the first season, stating that the portrayal in the series did not reflect her real life, but she commended the overall effect of the first season.</p> <p>Max Borenstein said he had a positive conversation with Jeanie Buss, and the atmosphere was pleasant.</p> <p>Rodney Barnes said, \"We are not simply making things up. Sometimes it's hard to accept that your favorite character has another side to their life, so you may consider it fake or a wrong depiction.\"</p> <p>To address this, the producers made preparations for the second season. They prepared a guide for journalists and the media, explaining the sources used in the series, including scenes from the third episode's awkward brunch and a crazy press conference scene in the fifth episode, which are based on real events. Are you a Lakers fan? Maybe you should go and watch this different portrayal of the Lakers' story.

This year was no exception, as the two teams had the same record of six wins and one loss before the game. The winner of this game would secure second place in this edition of the Jones Cup.</p> <p>The first quarter of the game was intense, with the teams evenly matched. Ateno finally shook off yesterday's gloom against the United States and scored 8 points in the paint in the first quarter. Liu Zheng, Abasi, and Lin Tingqian also contributed points, giving Team Chinese Blue a 22-18 lead. In the second quarter, Ateno continued to demonstrate his dominant presence in the paint, scoring 13 points.

Their home attendance had declined for eight consecutive seasons, with an average of 8,009 fans attending games during the 1986-87 season. They were not only the smallest market in the NBA, but San Antonio's television market was also ranked 42nd in the United States. The Spurs were at the bottom in terms of revenue, season ticket sales, and any other relevant indicators.</p> <p>The main problem was the team's performance. Since the departure of their star player \"The Iceman\" George Gervin in 1985, the Spurs, who had reached the Western Conference Finals for two consecutive years in the early 1980s (and had made it to the playoffs for 10 consecutive years in the ABA and NBA), began to decline. Their winning percentage never exceeded fifty percent. \"The team was dead,\" said McCombs.</p> <p>\"We are at a critical moment as a team,\" said Bob Bass, the general manager at the time. \"We need to do something to bring the fans back to the arena.\"</p> <p>If the Spurs hadn't been lucky enough to win the first overall pick in 1987, it is likely that the last professional sports team in San Antonio would not have stayed. McCombs recalled that NBA Commissioner David Stern told him in 1987 that the Spurs might not survive in San Antonio, and McCombs couldn't argue against it.</p> <p>However, with the first overall pick, the Spurs rewrote the basketball history of South Texas. All hope in the Alamo City was placed on a seven-foot naval officer: David Robinson.</p> <p>Typical NBA top picks usually start to shine in seventh or eighth grade, taller, faster, and better skilled than their peers. They dominate in high school, participate in high-level basketball camps, are pursued by college basketball coaches, make a name for themselves in college basketball, and become highly sought-after top picks surrounded by fans.</p> <p>But in 1987, Robinson, the consensus top pick, didn't follow the typical path. He only had one year of high school basketball experience, didn't attend basketball camps, and when he entered college, he was only 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. He attended the United States Naval Academy, and his dream was only to become a naval officer. Professional basketball was not even on his wish list.</p> <p>However, the maximum height limit for admission to the Naval Academy was 6 feet 6 inches, and Robinson grew seven inches after enrolling, instantly becoming the center of attention. He grew taller, but his coordination and speed remained outstanding. On the court, he was faster and taller than anyone else. \"I didn't even notice how fast I was growing,\" said the 7-foot-1-inch Robinson. \"I just noticed more and more people looking at me and saying, 'Man, you have to play basketball!'\"</p> <p>Approximately 5% of Naval Academy students continue to grow to 6 feet 8 inches after enrollment, but this height is still not enough to establish oneself in Division I college basketball. Moreover, the Naval Academy is not primarily a basketball school. Since 1933, no player from the Naval Academy has been selected to the All-American team.</p> <p>However, having a 7-foot giant at the Naval Academy allowed the team, led by Robinson, to become a powerhouse in the NCAA. They not only returned to the NCAA Tournament's round of 64 for the first time since 1960 but also made it to the Elite Eight, breaking the school record. Robinson also grew into a super beast, receiving transfer invitations from many colleges and becoming the highly coveted future top pick in the NBA. Getting a multi-million-dollar contract in the professional league was not a problem.</p> <p>But being at the Naval Academy raised questions about Robinson's basketball career. When asked about Robinson's weaknesses, Bob Ferry, the general manager of the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards), bluntly said, \"Yes, his weakness is that he is in the Navy.\" Because Naval Academy graduates have to serve for five years, whether Robinson should transfer to another basketball powerhouse to solve his military service issue became a headline discussion at the time.</p> <p>However, Robinson's father was a loyal navy man, which made Robinson determined to stay in the Navy, effectively blocking his path to the NBA. This caused a big controversy. However, the Navy found a win-win solution. Having Robinson stay not only proved the loyalty of a Navy man, but the perfect gentleman Robinson also became a ready-made advertising face for the military. However, his 7-foot stature still had limitations for some submarine missions. Therefore, the Navy adjusted Robinson's service period to two years, achieving a situation where everyone was happy.</p> <p>Robinson could remain loyal, and the NBA could have the next generation of centers. For the Spurs, who were in dire straits both on and off the court at the time, having the opportunity to choose Robinson in the lottery was a godsend for the entire team. Robinson not only played the crucial center position in the NBA at the time but also excelled off the court. He scored 1320 on the SAT, majored in mathematics at the Naval Academy, and was talented in music and computers. Besides basketball, he also dabbled in gymnastics, bowling, golf, taekwondo, and tennis, and was known for being humble and easygoing.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132459881258/","title":"Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team as they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the series with a 2-4 score","text":"<p>Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team as they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the series with a 2-4 score. This loss could potentially lead to a restructuring of the Warriors' roster in the upcoming years.</p> <p>Steve Kerr, who is 57 years old, has been coaching the Warriors since the 2014-15 season. Prior to this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect 19-0 record in the playoffs against Western Conference teams. This means that whenever the Warriors made it to the playoffs, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won the championship four times. Despite finishing sixth in the regular season, the Warriors had to battle until the seventh game against the Sacramento Kings, a team making their first playoff appearance, to advance.</p> <p>Looking at the Warriors' main rotation, it is unlikely that they would trade their star player Stephen Curry, whose contract runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the \"Splash Brothers,\" is a possible target for the team. According to reports from US sports media, Thompson will be in his final year of contract next year with a salary of $43.21 million. Although the Warriors have the option to extend his contract, there have been rumors that the team wants Thompson to take a pay cut. Additionally, Draymond Green, although having a player option for the next season, must decide whether to execute it before June 30, 2023. While the Warriors are interested in re-signing him, it is uncertain whether they would offer him a maximum contract. If Green becomes a free agent, there are several teams interested in acquiring him. Besides the three main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only averaged 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, has expressed his desire to be traded to a team that will give him more opportunities.</p> <p>In the Western Conference Semifinals of the NBA playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, with a final score of 122-101. The Lakers will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers had a 3-2 advantage going into the game, and they outperformed the Warriors in various aspects. LeBron James scored 30 points, grabbed 9 rebounds, and had 9 assists, while Anthony Davis contributed 17 points and 20 rebounds, despite suffering a head injury in the game against Kevon Looney. Austin Reaves scored 23 points, making 4 out of 5 three-pointers, contributing to the Lakers' dominant performance throughout the game.</p> <p>On the Warriors' side, Andrew Wiggins, who had a rib injury, played in the game, and Stephen Curry scored a game-high 32 points. However, Klay Thompson struggled, and the team's three-point shooting, usually a strong suit, only made 13 out of 48 attempts. The Lakers led by a small margin of 31-26 after the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Warriors continued to struggle with their three-point shooting, making only 5 out of 23 attempts in the first half. Curry and Thompson combined for only 20 points in the first half.</p> <p>LeBron James scored 15 points in the first half, including three-pointers. Before the end of the first half, Austin Reaves made a buzzer-beating three-pointer, giving the Lakers a 56-46 lead. In the second half, Reaves continued to make three-pointers, and D'Angelo Russell also contributed, extending the Lakers' lead to double digits.</p> <p>With a 91-77 lead going into the fourth quarter, the Lakers maintained their advantage. The Warriors showed some improvement in the fourth quarter, but Draymond Green faced foul trouble, and Rui Hachimura blocked Klay Thompson's shot. With over 8 minutes remaining in the game, there was already a 20-point difference between the two teams.</p> <p>As the Warriors struggled on the road this season, their morale was shaken. With 6 minutes and 20 seconds left in the third quarter, both teams received technical fouls due to a collision under the basket, and Lakers' starter Dennis Schroder was ejected from the game.</p> <p>The Lakers entered the fourth quarter with a 91-77 lead, and the Warriors could only make a slight comeback. Draymond Green faced foul trouble, while the Lakers' Rui Hachimura blocked Klay Thompson. With over 8 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, there was already a 20-point difference between the two teams, sealing the Lakers' victory. The seventh seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers defeated the second seed Memphis Grizzlies in the first round and then eliminated the defending champions Warriors in the second round. They will face the top-seeded Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals, creating a rare occurrence in this year's NBA playoffs where both the Eastern and Western Conference Finals feature the seventh or eighth seed.</p> <p>In the earlier game, the eighth seed Miami Heat eliminated the New York Knicks, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132526274485/","title":"SBL2023 Rookie Draft Results Announced with 11 Players Selected, the Most in the SBL","text":"<p>The SBL held its 2023 Rookie Draft today, selecting a total of 11 players, the highest number among all leagues    SBL2023 Rookie Draft Results Announced with 11 Players Selected, the Most in the SBL</p> <p>The SBL held its 2023 Rookie Draft today, selecting a total of 11 players, the highest number among all leagues.

If you're interested in legal and business collaborations, go to [Yuyu Lawyer - Yu Zongming]. </p> <p>The \"Just down the bull's head but up the heart\" series focuses on players who have recently left the Chicago Bulls and moved to other teams. The first article in this series discussed Lauri Markkanen and was completed last September. I am delighted that he has validated my belief in him during his time with the Utah Jazz. Now, let's talk about Wendell Carter Jr., who was traded to the Orlando Magic as part of the Nikola Vucevic trade.</p> <p>But the discussion points I want to focus on are not just about the success or failure of this trade, as his current performance along with Franz Wagner can already determine that. Nor is it about WCJ's development with the Magic, as I do not have enough knowledge to provide a better judgment on that. What I want to discuss is whether the Bulls had better options at the time, even in hindsight. </p> <ul> <li>The trade dilemma caused by developmental issues Is it all his fault? Before discussing Wendell Carter Jr.'s trade, let's take a look at WCJ when he was traded and WCJ in the Orlando Magic. Can they be compared? To put it bluntly, when the Chicago Bulls traded WCJ, many Bulls fans disliked his on-court performance and felt that the 7th overall pick was wasted.</li> </ul> <p>When I say \"many Bulls fans,\" it means that it wasn't my view at the time. I believe WCJ did face challenges and difficulties, but it included factors such as coaching and team composition, not just his individual abilities.</p> <p>At this point, I want to discuss something. A phenomenon is often caused by various factors and effects to different extents. For example, when we mentioned earlier that WCJ couldn't overcome the coaching and team composition issues, we are not saying that the player has no ability to solve it autonomously or that the player doesn't need to take responsibility. We need to consider to what extent and under what circumstances the player should be held accountable. The reason I bring up this concept is that we need to discuss who should be held responsible for WCJ's challenges, and many people believe it is Jim Boylen. But when I say \"many people,\" it means I have some differing views.</p> <ul> <li>Not knowing what happened before the problems arose I don't know the age range of friends here, but do you remember a character named Wang Yuyan in Jin Yong's novels? She didn't possess martial arts skills herself, but she had a deep understanding of martial arts, and through her guidance, she could greatly enhance the effectiveness of her allies in battles.</li> </ul> <p>In NBA games, occasionally, there are players with similar qualities. Their unique skills and talents, coupled with their understanding of the game, always allow them to unite their teammates and bring out performances that surpass their individual talents.</p> <p>To put it in less martial arts terms, they possess the effects of a \"Glue Guy\" and a catalyst. On one hand, they bring together many individual and team aspects of the game, and on the other hand, they catalyze better chemistry on the court. So if you find such a rare player, wouldn't you want to maximize their qualities in your team composition? Good and lucky examples are Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Poor examples are Lonzo Ball and Otto Porter Jr. from the Chicago Bulls. As for OPJ, besides his recent role as an important bench player for the Golden State Warriors in the 2021-22 season, does he possess the unique qualities I mentioned to the same extent? In OPJ's performance after being traded from the Washington Wizards to the Bulls in the 2018-19 season, he achieved the following statistics:  - Points: 17.5 - Rebounds: 5.5 - Assists: 2.7 - Steals: 1.2 - Blocks: 0.6 - Shooting percentages: 48.3/48.8/90.6 - Average 2.6 three-pointers made per game</p> <p>To describe it qualitatively, at that time, OPJ was a versatile forward who could defend from the wing to the rim, act as a secondary defender, and serve as a defensive leader. On the offensive end, he had ball-handling skills, transition playmaking abilities, the ability to space the floor, and a high shooting accuracy, both in pull-up and catch-and-shoot situations.</p>"},{"location":"20230823100629136207/","title":"Review of the Top Keywords in June 2022: Warriors Win NBA Championship, BTS Announces Solo Careers without Disbanding","text":"<p>In just one more week, 2022 will come to an end    Review of the Top Keywords in June 2022: Warriors Win NBA Championship, BTS Announces Solo Careers without Disbanding</p> <p>In just one more week, 2022 will come to an end.

As seen in the chart, many keywords were related to the NBA due to the NBA Finals taking place this month.</p> <p>The NBA Finals featured a competition between the Warriors and the Celtics. In the end, on June 17th, the Golden State Warriors won with a score of 4-2, making NBA the most popular keyword of the day. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Taiwan had passed its peak, and the daily number of confirmed cases continued to decline.</p> <p>However, there was concern about Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which could appear in children about a month after being diagnosed with COVID-19. The Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center announced the number of MIS-C cases and related information during their daily press conferences. During this wave of the pandemic, a tragic incident occurred in New Taipei City where a child may have passed away due to delayed medical treatment. The child's father believes that the city government should take responsibility, and the investigation into this incident is still ongoing.</p> <p>Another popular keyword in June was \"Amazon Rainforest,\" which appeared on May 24th. This keyword trended not because of any local events related to the Amazon Rainforest, but because someone discovered that Google Maps displayed incorrect photos for locations in the Amazon Rainforest. Instead of showing photos related to the rainforest, it displayed explicit photos of a couple in a bathroom, leading to a surge in search volume. In terms of finance and economics, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop this month, falling below $20,000 and returning to its price from the end of 2020. The cryptocurrency market faced a harsh winter.</p> <p>On the 16th, the Federal Reserve announced a three-digit interest rate hike to combat inflation, which was the first time in 28 years for the United States. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen continued to depreciate, reaching a new low in 20 years. As a result, both Bitcoin and interest rate hikes became hot search terms.</p> <p>In terms of entertainment and cultural news, the release of \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" and the free availability of the game \"Among Us\" were trending keywords. Additionally, the exhibition \"Hell and Ghosts of Asia\" at the Tainan Art Museum gained popularity on social media, particularly the section featuring zombies, making the museum a trending keyword. In society, earthquakes and typhoons remained topics of interest. On June 16th, a fire in Hsinchu resulted in the death of eight family members and one injury.

In late March 2023, when the Lakers were still seeking a playoff spot, I wrote an essay called \"Peak Essays\" about the rise and excellent performance of Austin Reaves, a white shooting guard known as AR15. Please continue reading. Reaves has been in the spotlight in Los Angeles, playing for the prestigious Lakers, and news and various comments about him have never stopped.</p> <p>In an anonymous NBA player poll before the end of the season, Reaves was selected as one of the most overrated and underrated players.</p> <p>His career started with going undrafted, which made him underrated (although later it was proven that it was deliberately planned by Reaves' camp). In his second season, he became a key player for the Lakers, which may have led to him being overrated (perhaps due to his skin color), leaving Reaves' true value and abilities shrouded in mystery. Former NBA player Rashad McCants said on a podcast that Reaves was overhyped simply because he is a white player on the Lakers and happened to rise up when the Lakers had many injured players. Who is McCants? He is a notable figure in college basketball, a scoring guard with explosive athleticism, and a product of the prestigious University of North Carolina, where he won a championship and was selected 14th overall by the Timberwolves in 2005.</p> <p>However, limited by his playing style and physique, McCants is a glaring example of a college scoring guard who failed to transition successfully.</p> <p>After his four-year rookie contract expired, he couldn't secure a second contract and couldn't make a name for himself in Europe either. He could only play in weaker leagues, and his professional career had nothing noteworthy. It's reasonable to say that McCants is bitter about not being able to taste the grapes, especially considering that Reaves has indeed received more opportunities.</p> <p>However, opportunities must be seized in order to make an impact. Otherwise, the Linsanity phenomenon wouldn't have been so precious. Please continue reading. Is Reaves overrated or underrated? Judging from his performance in the latter part of the season and throughout the playoffs, I personally believe that Reaves is without a doubt the real deal, at least a qualified starter. At just 25 years old, he still has room for improvement.</p> <p>If we say that regular season performance has limited reference value, then what about the intensity of the playoffs? Reaves' performance in the play-in tournament was average, but he shone brighter in the playoffs.</p> <p>In his first-ever playoff journey, Reaves started in all 16 games, playing over 36 minutes per game and averaging 17 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.6 assists with only 1.6 turnovers per game.</p> <p>His performance dipped in the second round, but he bounced back strongly in the Western Conference Finals, averaging over 20 points per game with an impressive shooting percentage, solidifying his role as the Lakers' third option after LeBron James and Anthony Davis.</p> <p>After the season ended, he was selected to represent the national team in the Basketball World Cup, continuing to write a remarkable chapter. Steve Kerr, coach of the USA national team and also the coach of the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers' opponent in the second round, said, \"Based on Reaves' performance in the Western Conference playoffs, it's an easy decision to choose him.\" International games value physicality, shooting, and on-court decision-making abilities. They hope that the primary ball handler can also possess the skills of shooting, cutting, and passing, as well as the ability to defend multiple positions without being exploited.</p> <p>Reaves possesses all these abilities and has a high understanding of the game, making his selection for the national team not accidental. Former Lakers teammate, now playing for the Philadelphia 76ers, Patrick Beverley, praised Reaves on his personal podcast, saying, \"What makes Reaves impressive is his basketball IQ, but he has been underestimated because of his appearance. From my experience playing with him, Reaves has a great understanding of the game, which is why he frequently gets to the free-throw line.\"</p> <p>In the NBA, there are two types of players who can get to the free-throw line in large numbers. One is those who possess incredible athleticism and physicality to dunk over opponents, and the other is those who are extremely smart.</p> <p>It's obvious that Reaves belongs to the second category. Reaves' abilities are well recognized by those in the basketball community, but due to his status as a restricted free agent, he didn't receive much interest in the market. With only two years of experience, he had no salary cap space to work with on the Lakers, so he had to settle for an early bird exception contract, signing a 4-year, $56 million contract with a player option in the fourth year, along with a 15% trade kicker. This contract is clearly lower than his market value, considering that Jordan Poole, who has a slightly stronger offensive firepower but weaker organization and defense, signed a 4-year, $128 million contract, and Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro signed a 4-year, $120 million contract, making Reaves' contract a steal for the Lakers. In recent years, NBA salaries have risen rapidly, and a young, high-quality starter is expected to earn at least $20 million per year, so Reaves' salary falls below his production. Whether it's with the Lakers or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves plays a similar role.</p> <p>Offensively, he mainly serves as a playmaker, occasionally initiating pick-and-rolls, and can make quick decisions when time is running out. He can switch between on-ball and off-ball roles, has a low turnover rate, and poses a threat from the perimeter. Defensively, Reaves is willing to fight and compete, making him a valuable asset for coaches. In preseason games, there were scenes where three guards were on the court at the same time. When Reaves first entered the league, he earned playing time through his defense, fearlessly guarding top guards like Ja Morant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He also received praise from his fellow Lakers alum and defensive stalwart, Alex Caruso, who went from being undrafted to earning a big contract. In the recent playoff journey, Reaves didn't neglect his defense, especially when he chased after the Warriors' Splash Brothers in the second round, and even his shooting was affected in the later stages of the series.</p>"},{"location":"20230823100748742203/","title":"Video: NBABruceBrown believes the toughest series was against the Timberwolves, not the Lakers","text":"<p>Video: NBABruceBrown believes the toughest series was against the Timberwolves, not the Lakers. LeBron ran out of gas in Game 4.</p> <p>Detroit Pistons guard Bruce Brown recently appeared on Theo Pinson's podcast.</p> <p>When asked if he had anticipated the Nuggets, whom he played for last season, sweeping the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, Brown said, \"I didn't think so. I didn't think we would sweep them. I thought they would win a game in Los Angeles.</p> <p>I knew we would take Game 3, and I thought they would win Game 4 because they were already down 0-3, and I thought they would play harder.</p> <p>But LeBron ran out of gas. He scored 30 points in the first half, right? How many points were they ahead? 15 points? \"We (in the first half) kept missing shots, but LeBron couldn't do it... He had to score 60 points to win.</p> <p>He couldn't do it, he was already exhausted. He started the third quarter so passively, and we thought, 'Oh, he can't do it anymore.'</p> <p>And we switched our defense on him, I defended him poorly, but AG (Aaron Gordon) was strong, and AG's performance throughout the playoffs was crucial.</p> <p>\" In Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, LeBron played the entire game for 47 minutes and 56 seconds, making 15 of 25 shots and scoring 40 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists. LeBron scored a career-high 31 points in the first half, setting a new record for his postseason career.

There are still some players who are worth a salary above the starter level, although they may not be superstars. They possess both a high ceiling and practical skills, and they are still lingering in the free agent market. Considering that there are at least two big names, James Harden and Damian Lillard, with the latter still searching for a solution, it may be difficult for the teams directly involved to complete a fair trade. Therefore, discussions should focus on how each team can predict the direction and directly or indirectly benefit their own team in this chess game. It feels like a temporary lull in the eye of the storm.</p> <p>Please continue reading. So, what can the Bulls do to join the battle? It may be related to the injury exception they applied for.</p> <p>Further reading: \"Season Summary,\" \"Bulls' Draft Day,\" \"Bulls' Free Agency Market,\" \"Bulls' Free Agency Market Initial Stage,\" \"Opinions on Other Teams' Free Agency Market Operations.\" Please continue reading.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Andre Drummond's Revelation: A recent video has been circulating wildly, featuring Drummond advising young players not to focus solely on statistics and complain, but rather on how to become a better team player. He shares his own experience of going from a player with a multi-million dollar contract to someone who is ignored. This speech to young players truly resonates. His year with the Chicago Bulls has been a meaningful one in terms of self-awareness and mindset, which is why he is willing to stay. If you remember, there was a period when he wasn't playing, and many people were criticizing the coach for freezing him out. However, it was later revealed that during that time, Drummond was questioning himself psychologically, and the coaching staff and team chose to support him through it. If you watch this video and still can't understand why the current coaching staff and coach have taken this path, and what the results are, then I truly believe that it is a matter of life experience and perspective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing Julian Phillips with the New CBA Second Round Exception: According to reports, the Chicago Bulls have signed Phillips, the 35th overall pick this year, to a four-year contract: 2023-24/1.6M, 2024-25/1.9M, 2025-26/2.2M, 2026-27/2.4M (Team Option). I initially thought this was part of the mid-level exception used to sign contracts, but after being reminded by netizens, it should be a standard contract under the new CBA for second-round picks. It is evident that the team values this rookie, as they have guaranteed him $5.7M, which is the second-highest among second-round picks. According to CBA rules, with this four-year contract signed by a second-round pick, the team must waive the fourth-year contract after the third year to make the player a restricted free agent. This is similar to the previous CBA regulations. The most famous recent cases under the previous CBA were the successful operations by the team to secure Lu Dort and the failed attempts with Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo, who claimed to have no emotional connection with their college teammate Jalen Brunson.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing Adama Sanogo to a Two-Way Contract: The Chicago Bulls have confirmed the signing of undrafted player Sanogo to a two-way contract. This rookie has shown both strengths and weaknesses in the current summer league. However, he reminds me of Detroit Pistons' Isaiah Stewart, who recently signed a 4-year, $64M contract extension with the Pistons. I haven't watched Stewart play much, except for the incident where he directly confronted LeBron James. Of course, I am aware of the discussions within the Pistons' community regarding his basketball intelligence, skill development, and role. However, it seems that at least within the Pistons organization, he has been given recognition and secured a place for himself amid competition from high-ceiling players like Marvin Bagley III and James Wiseman.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Even though the modern style of play seems to be shrinking the market for this type of center, players like Kevon Looney, Wendell Carter Jr., and even Steven Adams have proven with their performances that even if they don't possess the talent or basketball awareness of Jaren Jackson Jr. or Draymond Green, they are willing to integrate into the team, understand each teammate's movements, and do what needs to be done to positively impact the game.</p>"},{"location":"20230823100838970781/","title":"Proud of the Li family: NBA player Kyle Anderson named Li Kai'er becomes the first naturalized basketball player in China","text":"<p>On the 24th, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that Kyle Anderson, who currently plays for the NBA's Timberwolves, has officially become a Chinese citizen, becoming China's first naturalized foreign basketball player   Proud of the Li family: NBA player Kyle Anderson named Li Kai'er becomes the first naturalized basketball player in China</p> <p>On the 24th, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that Kyle Anderson, who currently plays for the NBA's Timberwolves, has officially become a Chinese citizen, becoming China's first naturalized foreign basketball player. He also announced on social media that he will wear the Chinese national team jersey to participate in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in August.</p> <p>Kyle Anderson was born in Fairview, New Jersey, USA. In the 2014 NBA Draft, he was selected by the Spurs in the first round as the 30th pick and played for them for 4 years.</p> <p>He has played for the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves throughout his career. Anderson is 206 cm tall and weighs 104 kg. He has an impressive wingspan of 220 cm. In the previous season, he played 69 games for the Timberwolves, averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks per game. He also had a three-point shooting percentage of 41% and a field goal percentage of 50.9%.</p> <p>In international competitions, Anderson has previously participated in the USA U16 and U17 training camps but has never represented the USA in games. This qualification aligns with FIBA's requirements for naturalized players, giving him the opportunity to switch nationalities and play for China. Anderson's connection to China comes from his maternal ancestry. His great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, giving him one-eighth Chinese heritage.</p> <p>Five years ago in 2018, he traveled to China with his mother to explore his roots and left the name Li Kai'er on his family's genealogy. It was then that news spread about the Chinese Basketball Association actively targeting Anderson as a naturalized player. After announcing his Chinese citizenship on the 24th, Anderson shared his journey of becoming a Chinese citizen on Weibo under the account name \"Big Hammer Li Kai'er.\" He recalled that the root-seeking trip in 2018 was very important to him, as it showed him where his roots lie and how deep they are. He also expressed pride and honor in having his name written in the Li family genealogy.</p> <p>He also announced on social media that he will represent the Chinese national team in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup in August.</p> <p>With Anderson becoming Li Kai'er, he becomes China's first naturalized basketball player. This not only involves a change in China's basketball style but also accelerates the transformation of Chinese basketball.</p> <p>Sports commentator Li Yishen believes that Anderson is an all-around player who can handle the ball, control the game, and pass effectively. He has a high basketball IQ and can activate China's inside game with his height and playmaking ability. Especially since China lacks sufficient power and defensive presence in the inside, Anderson's addition can help the tall players in the team by creating space, organizing plays, and creating scoring opportunities.</p> <p>However, Anderson's joining also brings concerns. Although he comes from the NBA, he does not possess the explosive athleticism or one-on-one scoring ability commonly seen in international competitions. It remains to be seen whether Anderson's unique playing style and slower pace can fit into China's basketball system. Li Yishen believes that Anderson is not the solution for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although he is unique, he is not an NBA superstar who can dominate major opponents in Asia by relying solely on ball handling, superhuman drives, and individual scoring. China needs top-level coaches and has room for improvement in player skills, physical training systems, and more.</p> <p>[Join Key Opinion Leaders website] Receive exciting articles directly in your inbox every day, exclusive selections from editors, current affairs, and arts and culture reports in weekly newsletters.
